I love Dr Seuss
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
Today you are You, that is truer than true
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
Oh, the places you'll go
Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one
You're off to Great Places! Today is your day!
