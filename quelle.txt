When I leave home to walk to school, Dad always says to me,/'Marco, keep your eyelids up And see what you can see."
But when I tell him where I've been And what I think I've seen,/He looks at me and sternly says, "Your eyesight's much too keen."
Stop telling such outlandish tales./Stop turning minnows into whales.
Now, what can I say When I get home today?
All the long way to school And all the way back,/I've looked and I've looked And I've kept careful track,/But all that I've noticed, Except my own feet,/Was a horse and a wagon On Mulberry Street.
That's nothing to tell of, That won't do, of course…/Just a broken-down wagon That's drawn by a horse./That can't be my story. That's only a start./I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart!/And that is a story that no one can beat,/When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street
Yes, the zebra is fine, But I think it's a shame,/Such a marvelous beast With a cart that's so tame./The story would really be better to hear/If the driver I saw were a charioteer./A gold and blue chariot's something to meet,/Rumbling like thunder down Mulberry Street
No, it won't do at all…/A zebra's too small./A reindeer is better; He's fast and he's fleet,/And he'd look mighty smart On old Mulberry Street.
Hold on a minute! There's something wrong!
A reindeer hates the way it feels/To pull a thing that runs on wheels./He'd be much happier, instead,/If he could pull a fancy sled.
Hmmmm … A reindeer and sleigh …/Say—anyone could think of that,/А Jack or Fred ог Joe or Nat—/Say, even Jane could think of that.
But it isn't too late to make one little change/A sleigh and an ELEPHANT! There’s something strange!/Say! That makes a story that nо one can beat,/When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.
But now I don't know… - It still doesn't seem right./An elephant pulling a thing that's so light/Would whip it around in the air like a kite./But he'd look simply grand/With a great big brass band!
A band that’s so good should have someone to hear it,/But it's going so fast that it's hard to keep near it./I'll put on a trailer! I know they won't mind/If a man sits and listens while hitched on behind.
But now is it fair? Is it fair what I've done?/I'll bet those wagons weigh more than a ton./Thats really too heavy a load for one beast;/I'll give him some helpers. He needs two, at least.
But now what worries me is this . ./Mulberry Street runs into Bliss./Unless there's something I can fix up,/There'll be an awful traffic mix-up!
It takes Police to do the trick,/То guide them through where traffic's thick/They'll never crash now. They'll race at top speed/With Sergeant Mulvaney, himself, in the lead./The Mayor is there And the Aldermen too,/All waving big banners Of red, white and blue.
The Mayor is there And he thinks it is grand,/And he raises his hat As they dash by the stand.
And that is a story that NO ONE can beat/When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street!
With a roar of its motor an airplane appears/And dumps out confetti while everyone cheers/And that makes a story that's really not bad/But it still could be better. Suppose that I add…
I swung 'round the corner And dashed through the gate,/I ran up the steps And I felt simply GREAT!
But Dad said quite calmly, "Just draw up your stool/And tell me the sights On the way home from school."
There was so much to tell, I JUST COULDN'T BEGIN!/Dad looked at me sharply and pulled at his chin./He frowned at me sternly from there in his seat,/“Was there nothing to look at … no people to greet?/Did nothing excite you or make your heart beat?"
FOR I HAD A STORY THAT NO ONE COULD BEAT!/AND TO THINK THAT I SAW IT ON MULBERRY STREET!
"Nothing," I said, growing red as a beet,/"But a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street."
Sighed Mayzie, a lazy bird hatching an egg:/“I’m tired and I’m bored/And I’ve kinks in my leg/From sitting, just sitting here day after day./It’s work! How I hate it!/I’d much rather play!
I’d take a vacation, fly off for a rest/If I could find someone to stay on my nest!/If I could find someone, I’d fly away-free…”/Then Horton, the Elephant, passed by her tree.
“Hello!” called the lazy bird, smiling her best,/“You’ve nothing to do and I do need a rest./Would you like to sit on the egg in my nest?”
The elephant laughed./“Why, of all silly things!/I haven’t feathers and I haven’t wings./Me on your egg? Why, that doesn’t make sense…/Your egg is so small, ma’am, and I’m so immense!”
“Tut, tut,” answered Mayzie. “I know you’re not small/But I’m sure you can do it. No trouble at all./Just sit on it softly. You’re gentle and kind./Come, be a good fellow. I know you won’t mind.”
“I can’t,” said the elephant/“PL-E-E-ASE!” begged the bird./“I won’t be gone long, sir. I give you my word./I’ll hurry right back. Why, I’ll never be missed….”/“Very well,” said the elephant, “since you insist…
You want a vacation. Go fly off and take it./I’ll sit on your egg and I’ll try not to break it./I’ll stay and be faithful. I mean what I say.”/“Toodle-oo!” sang out Mayzie and fluttered away.
“H-m-m-m..the first thing to do,” murmured Horton,/“Let’s see…/The first thing to do is to prop up this tree/And make it much stronger. That has to be done/Before I get on it. I must weigh a ton.”
Then carefully,/Tenderly,/Gently he crept/Up the trunk to the nest where the little egg slept./Then Horton the elephant smiled. “Now that’s that…”/And he sat/And he sat/And he sat/And he sat….
And he sat all that day/And he kept the egg warm…/And he sat all that night/Through a terrible storm./It poured and it lightninged!/It thundered! It rumbled!/“This isn’t much fun,”/The poor elephant grumbled.
“I wish she’d come back/‘Cause I’m cold and I’m wet./I hope that that Mayzie bird doesn’t forget.”
But Mayzie, by this time, was far beyond reach,/Enjoying the sunshine way off in the Palm Beach,/And having such fun, such a wonderful rest,/Decided she’d never go back to her nest!
So Horton kept sitting there, day after day./And soon it was Autumn. The leaves blew away./And then came the Winter…the snow and the sleet!/And icicles hung/From his trunk and his feet.
But Horton kept sitting, and said with a sneeze,/“I’ll stay on this egg and I won’t let it freeze./I meant what I said/And I said what I meant…/An elephant’s faithful/One hundred per cent!”
So poor Horton sat there/The whole winter through…/And then came the springtime/With troubles anew!
His friends gathered round/And they shouted with glee./“Look! Horton the Elephant’s up in a tree!”
They taunted, they teased him,/They yelled, “How Absurd!”/“Old Horton the Elephant/Thinks He's a bird!”
They Laughed and they Laughed, Then they all ran away./And Horton was lonely. He wanted to play/but he sat on the egg and continued to say/“I meant what I said/And I said what I meant…/An elephant’s faithful/One hundred per cent!
“No matter What happens,/This egg must be tended!”/But poor Horton’s troubles/Were far, far from ended/For, while Horton sat there/So faithful, so kind,/Three hunters came sneaking/Up softly behind!
He heard the men’s footsteps!/He turned with a start!/Three rifles were aiming/Right straight at his heart!/Did he run?/He did not!/HORTON STAYED ON THAT NEST!/He held his head high/And he threw out his chest
And he looked at the hunters/As much as to say:/“Shoot if you must/But I won’t run away!/I meant what I said/And I said what I meant…/An elephant’s faithful/One hundred per cent!”
But the men didn’t shoot!/Much to Horton’s surprise/They dropped their three guns/And they stared with wide eyes!/“look!” they all shouted,/“Can such a thing be?/An elephant sitting on top of a tree…”
“It’s strange! It’s amazing! It’s wonderful! New!/Don’t shoot him. We’ll catch him. That’s just what we’ll do!/Let’s take him alive. Why, he’s terribly funny!/We’ll sell him back home to a circus, for money!”
And the first thing he knew, they had built a big wagon/With ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on./They dug up his tree and they put it inside,/With Horton so sad that he practically cried.
“We’re off!” the men shouted. And off they all went/With Horton unhappy, one hundred per cent.
Up out of the jungle! Up into the sky!/Up over the mountains ten thousand feet high!/Then down, down the mountains/And down to the sea/Went the cart with the elephant,/Egg, nest and tree…
Then out of the wagon/And onto a ship!/Out over the ocean…/And ooh, what a trip!
Rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray!/And Horton said, day after day after day,/“I meant what I said/And I said what I meant…/But oh, am I seasick!/One hundred per cent!”
After bobbing around for two weeks like a cork,/They landed at last in the town of New York.
“All ashore!” the men shouted,/And down with a lurch/Went Horton the Elephant/Still on his perch,/Tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him…/Bump!/Horton landed!/And then the men sold him!
Sold to a circus! Then week after week/They showed him to people at ten cents a peek./They took him to Boston, to Kalamazoo,/Chicago, Weehawken and Washington, too;/To Dayton, Ohio; St. Paul, Minnesota;/To Wichita, Kansas; to Drake, North Dakota.
And everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see/And laugh at the elephant up in a tree./Poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went,/But he said as he sat in the hot noisy tent:/“I meant what I said, and I said what I meant…/An elephant’s faithful—one hundred per cent!”
Then…one day/The circus show happened to reach/A town way down south, not so far from Palm Beach./And, dawdling along way up high in the sky,/Who (of all people!) should chance to fly by/But that old good-for-nothing bird, runaway Mayzie!/Still on vacation and still just as lazy.
And, spying the flags and the tents just below,/She sang out, “What fun! Why, I’ll go to the show!”/And she swooped from the clouds/Through an open tent door…/“Good gracious!” gasped Mayzie,/“I’ve seen you before!”
Poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk!/He started to speak, but before he could talk…/There rang out the noisiest ear-splitting squeaks/From the egg that he’d sat on for fifty-one weeks!
A thumping! A bumping! A wild alive scratching!/“My egg!” Shouted Horton. “My egg! Why, it’s hatching!”
“But it’s Mine!” screamed the bird, when she heard the egg crack./(The work was all done. Now she wanted it back.)/“It’s my egg!” she sputtered. “You stole it from me!/Get off of my nest and get out of my tree!”
Poor Horton backed down/With a sad, heavy heart…/But at that very instant, the egg burst apart!
And out of the pieces of red and white shell,/From the egg that he’d sat on so long and so well,/Horton the Elephant saw something whizz!/It had ears/And a tail/And a trunk just like his!
And the people came shouting, “what’s all this about…?”/They looked! And they stared with their eyes popping out!/Then they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more./They’d never seen anything like it before!
“My goodness! My gracious!” they shouted. “My word!/It’s something brand new!/It’s an elephant-bird!!
And it should be, it should be, it should be like that!/Because Horton was faithful! He sat and he sat!/He meant what he said/And he said what he meant…”/…And they sent him home happy,/One hundred per cent!
"Young man,” laughed the farmer,/"You're sort of a fool!/You'll never catch fish/In McElligot’s Pool!”
“The pool is too small,/And, you might as well know it,/When people have junk/Here's the place that they throw it.
"You might catch a boot/Or you might catch a can./You might catch a bottle,/E But listen, young man…/If you sat fifty years/With your worms and your wishes,/You'd grow a long beard/Long before you'd catch fishes!"
“Hmmm…” answered Marco,/"It may be you're right. I've been here three hours/Without one single bite./There might be no fish…/"… But, again,/Well, there might!"
"Cause you never can tell/What goes on down below!/“This pool might be bigger/Than you or I know!”
This MIGHT bc a pool, like I've read of in books,/Connected to one of those underground brooks!/An underground river that starts here and flows/Right under the pasture! And then…well, who knows?
It might go along, down where no one can sec,/Right under State Highway Two-Hundred-and-Threc!/Right under the wagons! Right under the toes/Of Mrs. Umbroso who's hanging out clothes!
It might keep on flowing… perhaps… who can tell?…/Right under the people in Snecden's Hotel!/Right under the grass where they're playing croquet!/Then under the mountains and far, far away!
"This might be a river,/Now mightn't it be,/Connecting/McElligot’s/Pool/With/The/Sea!/Then maybe some fish might be swimming toward me!/(If such a thing could be, They certainly would be!)
Some very smart fellow might point out the way/To the place where I'm fishing. And that's why I say/If I wait long enough; if I'm patient and cool,/Who knows what I'll catch in McElligot’s Pool!
I might catch a thin fish,/I might catch a stout fish./I might catch a short or a long, long drawn out fish
Any kind! Any shape! Any color or size!/1 might catch some fish that would open your eyes!
I won't be surprised if a Dog Fish appears!/Complete with a collar and long floppy cars!/Whoofing along! And perhaps he might chase/A whole lot of Catfish right straight to this place!
I might catch a fish/With a pinwheel-like tail!/I might catch a fish/Who has fins like a sail!
I might catch some young fish/Some high-jumping friskers./I might might catch catch an an old old one With long flowing whiskers!
I might catch a fish/With a long curly nose./1 might catch a fish/Like a rooster that crows.
T might catch a fish/With a checkerboard belly,/Or even a fish/Made of strawberry jelly!
I might catch a Sea Horse./(Now mightn't I now…?)
I might catch a fish/Who is partly a cow!
Some fish from the Tropics, all sunburned and hot,/Might decide to swim up!/Well they might…/Might they not?/Racing up north for a chance to get cool,/Full steam ahead for McElligot's Pool!
Some Eskimo Fish/From beyond Hudson Bay/Might decide to swim down;/Might be headed this way!/It's a pretty long trip,/But they might/And they may.
I might catch an ecl…/(Well, I might. It depends.)/„А long twisting eel/With a lot of strange bends/And, oddly enough,/With a head on both ends!/One doesn’t catch this kind of fish as a rule,/But the chances are fine in McElligot's Pool!
I might catch a fish/With a terrible grouch…/Or an Australian fish/With a kangaroo's pouch!
Who wants to catch small ones like mackerel or trout!/SAY! I'll catch a Saw Fish with such a long snout/That he needs an assistant to help him about!/If I wait long enough, if I'm patient and cool,/Who knows what I'll catch in McElligot's Pool!
Some rough-neck old Lobster,/AII gristle and muscle,/Might grab at my bait,/Then would I have a tussle!/To land one so tough might take two or three hours,/But the next might be easy…/…the kind that likes flowers
I might catch some sort of a fast-moving bloke/Who zips through the waves with an over-arm stroke!/(I might and I may and that's really no joke!)
A fish even faster!/A fish, if you please,/Who slides down the sides/Of strange islands on skis!/He might ski on over and pay me a visit,/That's not impossible…really, now is it?
Some Circus Fish?/Fish from an acrobat school,/Might stage a big show in McElligot's Pool
Or I might catch a fish/From a stranger place yet!/From the world's highest river/In far-off Tibet,/Where the falls are so steep/That it's dangerous to ride ‘em,/So the fish put up chutes/And they float down beside 'em.
From the world's deepest ocean,/From way down below,/From down in the mud where the deep-divers go,/From down in the mire and the muck and the murk,/I might catch some fish who are all going, “GLURK!”
WHALES!/I'll catch whales!/Yes, a whole herd of whales!/All spouting their spouts/And all thrashing their tails!/I'll catch fifty whales,/Then I'll stop for the day/"Cause there's nothing that's bigger/Than whales, so they say.
Still of course, it might be…/…that there IS something bigger!/me sort of a kind of/A THING-A-MA-JIGGER!!/A fish that's so big, if you know what I mean,/That makes a whale look like a tiny sardine!
Oh, the sea is so full of a number of fish,/If a fellow is patient, he might get his wish.
And that's why I think/That I'm not such a fool/When I sit here and fish/In McElligot's Pool!
Up at Lake Winna-Bango… the far northern shore…/Lives a huge herd of moose, about sixty or more,/And they all go around in a big happy bunch/Looking for nice tender moose-moss to munch.
Up at the lake Winna-Bango, one day, they were lunching,/Just strolling along and enjoying their munching…/(For the moose-moss that day was especially fine)…/When it happened that Thidwick, the last moose in line,/Saw a Bingle Bug sitting.
The bug called out, “Hey!/It’s such a long road and it’s such a hot day,/Would you mind if I rode on your horns for a way?”
“Of course not!” smiled Thidwick, the Big-Hearted Moose./“I’m happy my antlers can be of some use./There’s room there to spare, and I’m happy to share!/Be my guest and I hope that you’re comfortable there!”
So the Bingle Bug picked out a nice easy seat/And the moose went on looking for moose-moss to eat.
Well… An hour or so later The bug heard a squeak,/And he heard the small voice of a Tree Spider speak.
“I say!” said the spider, “you’ve got a nice place!/That moose seems quite friendly, has such a nice face…/If I got on, too, Do you think he would mind…?”/“Hop aboard!” laughed the bug. “And I think that you’ll find/that moose won’t object. He’s the big hearted kind!”
“I accept,” said the spider, with joy and delight.”/And he started a web on the horn to the right./While the spider was spinning, he heard a gay song/and a fresh little Zinn-a- zu bird came along.
He stopped. And he stared. And he chirped, “Well! Well! WELL!/What a smart place to build! What a great place to dwell!/I’ve been living on trees ever since I was born,/but here’s something new! Why not live in a horn!
If there’s room there for two, then there’s room there for three!”/“There’s plenty of room!” Laughed the bug. “And it’s free!”
Thidwick stopped walking. What was all that talking?/These guests had caught Thidwick the Moose unawares./“Hey!” he called out. “What goes on there upstairs?”
“Just building a nest, sir.” The Zinn-a-zu said,/And began yanking hairs out of poor Thidwick’s head./And he plucked out exactly two hundred and four!/“Don’t worry,” he laughed. “you can always grow more!”
Then he dozed off to sleep in his fine moose hair nest./“This bird,” murmured Thidwick “is sort of a pest!/But I’m a good sport, so I’ll just let him rest,/For a host, above all, must be nice to his guest.”
“Besides, now, it’s getting quite late in the day/and surely tomorrow they’ll all go away.”
But, alas! The next morning the sun's early light/Brought to Thidwick’s sad eyes a most unwelcome sight…
“Meet my wife!” said the bird. “I was married last night./“And, perhaps by the way, I should mention to you/that her uncle is coming to live with us, too.
You’re a very fine host so I knew you’d be willing…”/Then the uncle, a woodpecker, started in drilling!
All Thidwick’s friends shouted, “GET RID OF THOSE PESTS!”/“I would, but I can’t.” sobbed poor Thidwick. “They’re guests!”/“Guests indeed!” his friends answered and all of them frowned./“If those are your guests, we don’t want you around!
You can’t stay with us, ’cause you’re just not our sort!”/And they all turned their backs and walked off with a snort.
Now the big friendless moose walked alone and forlorn,/with four great big woodpecker holes in his horn./“What holes!” whispered Hernan, a squirrel, who spied ’em./“What holes to hide nuts in! Hmmm! Mind if I tried ’em?”
“They’re yours!” called the woodpecker. “Get right inside ’em!/This big-hearted moose runs a public hotel!/Bring your nuts! Bring your wife! Bring your children as well!”/So the whole squirrel family all jumped on, pell-mell.
And the very next thing the poor animal knew,/A bobcat and turtle were living there, too!/NOW what was the big-hearted moose going to do?/Well what would YOU do if it happened to YOU?
You couldn’t say “Skat!” ’cause that wouldn’t be right./You couldn’t shout “Scram!” ’cause that isn’t polite.
A host has to put up with all kinds of pests,/for a host, above all, must be nice to his guests./So you’d try hard to smile, and you’d try to look sweet/and you’d go right on looking for moose-moss to eat.
But now it was winter and that wasn’t easy,/For moose-moss gets scarce when the weather gets freezy./The food was soon gone on the cold northern shore/of Lake Winna-Bango. There just was no more!
And all Thidwick’s friends swam away in a bunch/To the south of the lake where there’s moose-moss to munch./He watched the herd leaving. And then Thidwick knew/he’d starve if he stayed here! He’d have to go, too!
He stepped in the water. Then, oh! What a fuss!/“STOP!” screamed his guests. “You can’t do this to us!/These horns are our home and you’ve no right to take/our home to the far distant side of the lake!”
“Be fair!” Thidwick begged, with a lump in his throat…./“We’re fair,” said the bug. “We’ll decide this by vote.
All those in favor of going, say ‘AYE,’/all those in favor of staying say ‘NAY’.”/“AYE!” shouted Thidwick, but when he was done…/“NAY!” they all yelled. He lost ’leven to one.
“We win!” screamed the guests, “by a very large score!”/And poor, starving Thidwick climbed back on the shore./Then, do you know what those pests did? They asked in some more!
They asked in a fox, who jumped in from the trees,/they asked in some mice and they asked in some fleas./They asked a big bear in and then, if you please,/came a swarm of three hundred and sixty-two bees!
Poor Thidwick sank down, with a groan, to his knees./And then, THEN came something that made his heart freeze./Bullets came zinging right past Thidwick’s face!/Guns were bang-binging all over the place!
“Get that moose! Get that moose!” Thidwick heard a voice call./“Fire again and shoot straight one and all!/We must get his head for the Harvard club wall!”
Thidwick took his heels with that load on his head!/With five hundred pounds on his horns, the moose fled!/He could have run faster without all those pests,/but a host, above all, must be nice to his guests.
Up canyon! Off cliff! Over wild rocky trail!/With bullets bang-bouncing around him like hail!/Up gully! Through gulch! And down slippery sluice,/with his hard-hearted guests raced the soft-hearted moose!
Then finally they had him!/Because of those pests, he had run out of luck,/because of those guests on his horns, he was stuck!/He gasped! He felt faint! And the whole world grew fuzzy!/Thidwick was finished, completely… …or WAS he…?
Finished…? Not Thidwick! DECIDEDLY NOT!/It’s true, he was in a most terrible spot,/But NOW he remembered a thing he’d forgot!
A wonderful something that happens each year/to the horns of all moose and the horns of all deer./Today was the day, Thidwick happened to know…/… That OLD horns come off so that NEW ones can grow!
And he called to the pests on his horns as he threw ’em,/“you wanted my horns; now you’re quite welcome to ’em!/Keep ’em! They’re yours! As of ME, I shall take/myself to the far distant side of the lake!”
And he swam Winna-Bango and found his old bunch,/and arrived just in time for a wonderful lunch/at the south of the lake, where there’s moose-moss to munch.
His old horns today are where you knew they would be./His guests are still on them, all stuffed, as they should be.
"It’s a pretty good zoo,"/Said young Gerald McGrew,/"And the fellow who runs it/Seems proud of it too.
But if I ran the zoo," Said young Gerald McGrew,/"I’d make a few changes. That’s just what I’d do.
The lions and tigers and that kind of stuff/They have up here now are not quite good enough./You see things like these in any old zoo./They’re awfully old-fashioned. I want something new!
So I’d open each cage, I’d unlock every pen,/Let the animals go and start over again./And somehow or other I think I could find/Some beasts of some beasts of a more unusual kind.
A four footed lion’s not much of a beast./The one in my zoo will have 10 feet at least./Five legs on the left and five more on the right./Then people will stare, and they’ll say, 'What a sight!'
My New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, will make people talk./My new zoo, McGrew zoo, will make people gawk./They’ll be so surprised, they’ll swallow their gum./They’ll ask when they see my strange animals come,/'Where do you suppose he gets things like that from?'
His animals all have such very odd faces/I’ll bet he must hunt them in very odd places./And that’s what I’ll do said young Gerald McGrew.
If you want to catch beasts you don’t see every day,/You have to go places quite out of the way./You have to go places no others can get to./You have to get cold and you have to get wet too.
I’ll catch 'em in caves, I’ll catch 'em in brooks,/I’ll catch 'em in crannies, I’ll catch 'em in nooks/That you don’t read about in geography books.
I’ll load up five boats with a family of Joats/Whose feet are like cows, but wear squirrel-skin coats,/And sit like dogs, but have voices like goats—/Excepting they can’t sing the very high notes.
And then I’ll go down to the Wilds of Nantucket,/And capture a family of Lunks in a bucket./Then people will say, 'Now I like that boy heaps./His New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is growing by leaps.
He captures them wild, he captures them meek,/He captures them slim, he captures them sleek./What do you suppose he will capture next week?'
In the far western part of southeast North Dakota/Lives a very fine animal called the Iota./But I’ll capture one Who is even much finer/In the northeastern west part of South Carolina.
When people see him they will say, 'Now by thunder!/This New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, is really a wonder!'
I’ll bag a big bug/Who is very surprising,/A feller who has/A propeller for rising/And zooming around making cross-country hops,/From Texas to Boston with only two stops./Now that kind of thing for a bug is just tops!
In a cave in Kartoom is a beast called a Natch/That no other hunter’s been able to catch./He’s hidden for years in his cave with a pout/And no one’s been able to make him come out.
But I’ll coax him out with a wonderful meal/That’s cooked by my cooks in my cooker mobile.
They’ll fix up a dish that is just to his taste;/Three chicken croquettes made of library paste./Then sprinkled with peanut shucks, pickled and spiced,/Then baked at 600 degrees and then iced.
It’s mighty hard cooking to cook up such feasts/But that’s how the New Zoo, McGrew Zoo, gets beasts.
'He hunts with such vims, he hunts with such vigor./His new zoo, McGrew’s Zoo, gets bigger and bigger.'/Then the whole town will gasp, ‘Why this boy never sleeps!/No keeper before ever kept what he keeps.
There’s no telling what that young fellow will do!’/And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Katroo/And bring back an It-Kutch a Preep and a Proo,/A Nerkle, a Nerd and a Seersucker too.
And people will say when they see those Bips bounding,/'This Zookeeper, New keeper’s simply astounding./He travels so far that you think he’d drop!/When do you suppose this young fellow will stop?'
Stop… ? Well, I should./But I won’t stop until I’ve captures the Fizza-ma-Wizza-ma-Dill,/The world's biggest bird from the Island of Gwark/Who only eats pine trees and spits out the bark./And boy! When I get him back home to my park,/The whole world will say,/'Young McGrew’s made his mark.'
I don't like to brag and I don't like to boast,/Said Peter T. Hooper, but speaking of toast/And speaking of kitchens and ketchup and cake/And kettles and stoves and the stuff people bake…/Well, I don’t like to brag, but I'm telling you, Liz,/That speaking of cooks, I'm the best that there is!
Why, only last Tuesday, when mother was out/I really cooked something worth talking about!
And that’s because ever since goodness knows when,/They've always been made from the eggs of a hen./Just a plain common hen! What a dumb thing to use/With all of the other fine eggs you could choose!
You see, I was sitting here, resting my legs/And I happened to pick up a couple of eggs/And I sort of got thinking —it’s sort of a shame/That scrambled eggs always taste always the same.
And so I decided that, just for a change,/I'd scramble a new kind of egg on the range./Some fine fancy eggs that no other cook cooks/Like the eggs of the Ruffle-Necked Sala-ma-goox!
A Sala-ma-goox’s!/Say! They should be good!/So I went out and found some/As quick as I could!
And while I was lugging them back to the house/I happened to notice a Tizzle-Topped Grouse/In a tree down the street. And I knew from her looks/That her egg and the egg of the Sala-ma-goox/Ought to mix mighty well; ought to taste simply super/When scrambled together by Peter T. Hooper.
So I took those eggs home and I frizzled ’em up./And I added some sugar. Two thirds of a cup./And a small pinch of pepper. And also a pound/Of horseradish sauce that was sitting around./And also some nuts. Then I tasted the stuff/And it tasted quite fine, But not quite fine enough.
To make the best scramble that's ever been made/A cook has to hook the best eggs ever laid./So I drove to the country, quite rather far out,/And I studied the birds that were flitting about.
I looked with great care at a Mop-Noodled Finch./I looked at a Beagle-Beaked-Bald-Headed Grinch.
And, also, I looked at a Shade-Roosting Quail/Who was roosting right under a Lass-a-lack’s tail.
And I looked at a Spritz and a Flannel-Wing Jay./But I just didn’t stop. I kept right on my way/‘Cause they didn’t have eggs. They weren't laying that day.
Then, suddenly… Boy! Up that hill a short space…/Birds! They were laying all over the place!/Great happy gay families with uncles and cousins/All laying fine strictly fresh eggs by the dozens!
Why, I'd have a scramble more super than super!/Scrambled eggs Super-dee-Dooper-dee-Booper/Special de luxe a-la-Peter T. Hooper!
I picked out the eggs in a most careful way./I only picked those that I knew were Grade-A./I only took eggs from the very best fowls./So I didn’t take eggs from the Twiddler Owls
‘Cause I knew that the eggs of those fellows who twiddle/Taste sort of like dust from inside a bass fiddle.
I went for the kind that were mellow and sweet/And the world’s sweetest eggs are the eggs of the Kweet/Which is due to those very sweet trout which they eat
And those trout … well, they're sweet ‘cause they only eat Wogs/And Wogs, after all, are the world’s sweetest frogs.
And the reason they're sweet is, whenever they lunch/It's always the world’s sweetest bees that they munch/And the reason no bees can be sweeter than these…/They only eat blossoms off Beezlenut Trees
And these Beezlenut Blossoms are sweeter than sweet/And that’s why I nabbed several eggs from the Kweet.
But I passed up the eggs of a bird called a Stroodel/Who's sort of a stork, but with fur like a poodle.
For they say that the eggs of this kind of a stork/Are gooey like glue and they stick to your fork,/And the yolks of these eggs, I am told, taste like fleece/While the whites taste like very old bicycle grease.
Then I went for the eggs of a Long-Legger Kwong./Now this Kwong .. . well, she’s built just a little bit wrong,/For her legs are so terribly, terribly long/That she has to lay eggs twenty feet in the air/And they drop, with a plop, to the ground from up there!
So unless you can catch 'em before the eggs crash/You haven't got eggs. You've got Long-Legger hash.
Eggs! I'd collected three hundred and two!/But I needed still more! And I suddenly knew/That the job was too big for one fellow to do.
So I telegraphed north to some friends near Fa-Zoal/Which is ten miles or so just beyond the North Pole.
And they all of them jumped in their Katta-ma-Side,/Which is sort of a boat made of sea-leopard’s hide,/Which they sailed out to sea to go looking for Grice,/Which is sort of a bird which lays eggs on the ice,
Which they grabbed with a tool which is known as a Squitsch,/‘Cause those eggs are too cold to be touched without which,/And while they were sending those eggs, I got word of/A bird that does something that’s almost unheard of!
It's hard to believe, but this bird called the Pelf/Lays eggs that are three times as big as herself!/How that Pelf ever learned such a difficult trick/I never found out. But I found that egg quick.
And I managed to get it down out of the nest/And home to the kitchen along with the rest.
But I didn’t stop then, ‘cause I knew of some ducks/By the name of the Single-File Zummzian Zuks/Who stroll, single file, through the mountains of Zumms/Quite oddly enough, with their eggs on their thumbs,
And some fellows in Zummz whom I happened to know/Just happened to capture a thousand or so,/And they wrapped up their eggs and they mailed them by air/Marked Special Delivery, Handle with Care.
I needed more helpers! And so for assistance/I called up a fellow, named Ali, long distance,/And Ali, as soon as he hung up the phone,/Picked up a small basket and started alone
To climb the steep crags and the jags of Mt. Strookoo/To fetch me the egg of a Mt. Strookoo Cuckoo.
Now these Mt. Strookoo Cuckoos/Are rather small gals…/But these Mt. Strookoo Cuckoos have lots of big pals!
They dived from the skies with wild cackling shrieks/And they jabbed at his legs and they stabbed at his cheeks/With their yammering, klammering, hammering beaks,
But Ali, brave Ali, he fought his way through/And he sent me that egg as I knew he would do/For my Scrambled Eggs Super-dee-Dooper-dee-Booper/Special de luxe a-la-Peter T. Hooper!
In the meanwhile, of course, I was keeping real busy/Collecting the eggs of the three-eyelashed Tizzy./They're quite hard to reach, so I rode on the top/Of a Ham-ikka-Schnim-ikka-Schnam-ikka Schnopp.
Then I found a great flock of South-West-Facing Cranes/And I guess they've got something that’s wrong with their brains.
For this kind of a crane, when she’s guarding her nest,/Will always stand facing precisely South West./So to get at those eggs wasn’t hard in the least./I came from behind. From, precisely, North East.
And I captured the egg of a Grickly Gractus/Who lays ‘em up high in a prickly cactus.
Then I went for some Ziffs. They're exactly like Zufts,/But the Ziffs live on cliffs and the Zuffs live on bluffs./And, seeing how bluffs are exactly like cliffs,/It’s mighty hard telling the Zuffs from the Ziffs.
But I know that the egg that I got from the bluffs,/If it wasn’t a Ziff’s from the cliffs, was a Zuff's.
Now I needed the egg of a Moth-Watching Sneth/Who's a bird who's so big she scares people to death!/And this awful big bird… Well, the reason they name her/The Moth-Watching Sneth its ‘cause that’s how they tame her.
She likes watching moths. Sort of quiets her mind./And while she is watching you sneak up behind/And you yank out her egg. So I got one, of course,/With the help of some friends and a very fast horse.
If you want to get eggs you can’t buy at a store,/You have to do things never thought of before./Why, to get at the egg of one very small Dawf,/We had to pry all of one mountain top off!
Then I heard of some birds who lay eggs, if you please,/That taste like the air in the holes in Swiss cheese/And they live in big Zinzibar-Zanzibar trees.
So I ordered a tree full. The job was immense,/But I needed those eggs, and said hang the expense!
I still needed one more! And I saved it for last…/The egg of the frightful Bombastic Aghast!/And that bird is so mean and that bird is so fast/That I had to escape on a Jill-ikka-Jast/A fleet-footed beast who can run like a deer/But looks sort of different. You steer him by ear.
All through with the searching! All through with the looking!/I had all I needed! And now for the cooking.
I rushed to the kitchen, the place where I'd stacked 'em./I rolled up my sleeves. I unpacked ’em and cracked ‘em/And shucked ‘em and chucked ‘em in ninety-nine pans./Then I mixed in some beans. I used fifty-five cans.
Then I mixed in some ginger, nine prunes and three figs/And parsley. Quite sparsely, Just twenty-two sprigs./Then I added six cinnamon sticks and a clove/And my scramble was ready to go on the stove!
And you know how they tasted?/They tasted just like…/Well, they tasted exactly,/Exactly just like… like Scrambled eggs Super-/Dee-Dooper-dee-Booper, Special de luxe/a-la-Peter T. Hooper.
On the fifteenth of May, in the Jungle of Nool,/In the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool,/He was splashing… enjoying the jungle’s great joys…/When Horton the elephant heard a small noise.
So Horton stopped splashing. He looked toward the sound./“That’s funny,” thought Horton. “There’s no one around.”/Then he heard it again! Just a very faint yelp/As if some tiny person were calling for help.
"I’ll help you," said Horton. “But who are you? Where?”/He looked and he looked. He could see nothing there/But a small speck of dust blowing past through the air.
“I say!” murmured Horton. “I’ve never heard tell/Of a small speck of dust that is able to yell./So you know what I think?… Why, I think that there must/Be someone on top of that small speck of dust!
Some sort of a creature of very small size,/Too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes…/Some poor little person who’s shaking with fear/That he’ll blow in the pool! He has no way to steer!
I’ll just have to save him. Because, after all,/A person’s a person, no matter how small.”
So, gently, and using the greatest of care,/The elephant stretched his great trunk through the air,/And he lifted the dust speck and carried it over/And placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover.
“Humpf!” humpfted a voice. ‘Twas a sour kangaroo./And the young kangaroo in her pouch said “Humpf” too./“Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin./A person on that?… Why, there never has been!”
“Believe me,” said Horton. “I tell you sincerely,/My ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly./I know there’s a person down there. And, what’s more,/Quite likely there’s two. Even three. Even four.
Quite likely… a family, for all that we know!/A family with children just starting to grow./So, please,” Horton said, “as a favor to me,/Try not to disturb them. Just please let them be.”
“I think you’re a fool!” laughed the sour kangaroo/And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, “Me, too!/You’re the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool!”/And the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool.
“What terrible splashing!” the elephant frowned./“I can’t let my very small person get drowned!/I’ve got to protect them. I’m bigger than they.”/So he plucked up the clover and hustled away.
Through the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread:/“He talks to a dust speck! He’s out of his head!/Just look at him walk with that speck on that flower!”/And Horton walked, worrying, almost an hour.
“Should I put this speck down?” Horton thought with alarm./“If I do, these small persons may come to great harm./I can’t put it down. And I won’t! After all/A person’s a person. No matter how small.”
Then Horton stopped walking. The speck-voice was talking!/The voice was so faint he could just barely hear it./“Speak up, please,” said Horton. He put his ear near it.
“My friend,” came the voice, “you’re a very fine friend./You’ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end./You’ve saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors./You’ve saved all our churches and grocery stores.”
“You mean…” Horton gasped, “you have buildings there, too?”/“Oh, yes,” piped the voice. “We most certainly do…/“I know,” called the voice, “I’m too small to be seen/But I’m mayor of a town that is friendly and clean.
Our buildings, to you, would seem terribly small/But to us, who aren’t big, they are wonderfully tall./My town is called Who-ville, for I am a Who/And we Whos are all thankful and grateful to you.”
And Horton called back to the Mayor of the town,/“You’re safe now. Don’t worry. I won’t let you down.”
But, just as he spoke to the mayor of the speck,/Three big jungle monkeys climbed up Horton’s neck!
The Wickersham Brothers came shouting, “What rot!/This elephant’s talking to Whos who are not!/There aren’t any Whos! And they don’t have a mayor!/And we’re going to stop all the nonsense! So there!”
They snatched Horton’s clover! They carried it off/To a black-bottomed eagle named Vlad Vlad-i-koff,/A mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing,/And they said, “Will you kindly get rid of this thing?”
And, before the poor elephant even could speak,/That eagle flew off with the flower in his beak.
All that late afternoon and far into the night/That black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight,/While Horton chased after, with groans, over stones/That tattered his toenails and battered his bones,
And begged, “Please don’t harm all my little folks,/Who have as much right to live as us bigger folks do!”/But far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping/And over his shoulder called back, “Quit your yapping.
I’ll fly the night through. I’m a bird. I don’t mind it./And I’ll hide this, tomorrow, where you’ll never find it!”
And at 6:56 the next morning he did it./It sure was a terrible place that he hid it./He let that small clover drop somewhere inside/Of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide!
“Find THAT!” sneered the bird. “But I think you will fail.”/And he left with a flip of his black-bottomed tail.
“I’ll find it!” cried Horton. “I’ll find it or bust!/I SHALL find my friends on my small speck of dust!”/And clover, by clover, by clover with care/He picked up and searched them, and called, “Are you there?”
But clover, by clover, by clover he found/That the one that he sought for was just not around./And by noon poor old Horton, more dead than alive,/Had picked, searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five.
Then, on through the afternoon, hour after hour…/Till he found them at last! On the three millionth flower!
“My friends!” cried the elephant. “Tell me! Do tell!/Are you safe? Are you sound? Are you whole? Are you well?
From down on the speck came the voice of the mayor:/“We’ve really had trouble! Much more than our share./When that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped,/We landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped.
Our tea-pots are broken. Our rocking-chairs smashed./And our bicycle tires all blew up when we crashed./So, Horton, please!” pleaded that voice of the mayor’s,/“Will you stick by us Whos while we’re making repairs?”
“Of course,” Horton answered. “Of course I will stick./I’ll stick by you small folks through thin and through thick!”
“Humpf!” Humpfed a voice! “For almost two days you’ve run wild/And insisted on chatting with persons who’ve never existed./Such carryings-on in our peaceable jungle!/We’ve had quite enough of your bellowing bungle!
And I’m here to state,” snapped the big kangaroo,/“That your silly nonsensical game is all through!”/And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, “Me, too!”
“With the help of the Wickersham Brothers and dozens/Of Wickersham uncles and Wickersham cousins/And Wickersham in-laws, whose help I’ve engaged,/You’re going to be roped! And you’re going to be caged!
And, as for our dust speck… hah! That we shall boil/In a hot steaming kettle of beezle-nut oil!”/“Boil it?…” gasped Horton! “Oh, that you can’t do!/It’s all full of persons! They’ll prove it to you!”
“Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!” Horton called./“Mr. Mayor! You’ve got to prove now that you really are there!/So call a big meeting. Get everyone out./Make every Who holler! Make every Who shout!
Make every Who scream! If you don’t, every Who/Is going to end up in a beezle-nut stew!”/And, down on the dust speck, the scared little mayor/Quick called a big meeting in Who-ville Town Square.
And his people cried loudly. They cried out in fear:/“We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!”/The elephant smiled: “That was clear as a bell./You kangaroos surely heard that very well.”
“All I heard,” snapped the big kangaroo,/“Was the breeze, and the faint sound of wind/Through the far distant trees./I heard no small voices. And you didn’t either.”/And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, “Me, neither.”
“Grab him!” they shouted. “And cage the big dope!/Lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope!/Tie the knots tight so he’ll never shake loose!/Then dunk that dumb speck in the beezle-nut juice!”
Horton fought back with great vigor and vim/But the Wickersham gang was too many for him./They beat him! They mauled him!/They started to haul him into his cage!
But he managed to call to the mayor:/“Don’t give up! I believe in you all!/A person’s a person, no matter how small!/And you very small persons will not have to die/If you make yourselves heard! So come on, now, and TRY!”
The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom./He started to smack it./And all over Who-ville, they whooped up a racket./They rattled tin kettles!/They beat on brass pans,/On garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans!/They blew on bazookas and blasted great toots/On clarinets, oom-pahs, and boom-pahs, and flutes!
Great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air./They rattled and shook the whole sky!/And the Mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo:/“Hey, Horton! How’s this?/Is our sound coming through?”
And Horton called back,/“I can hear you just fine./But the Kangaroo’s ears aren’t as strong, quite, as mine./They don’t hear a thing!/Are you sure all your boys/Are doing their best?/Are they ALL making noise?
Are you sure every Who down in Who-ville is working?/Quick! Look through your town!/Is there anyone shirking?”
Through the town rushed the Mayor,/From the east to the west./But everyone seemed to be doing his best./Everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping!/Everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping!
But it wasn’t enough, all this ruckus and roar!/He HAD to find someone to help him make more./He raced through each building!/He searched floor-to-floor!
And, just as he felt he was getting nowhere,/And almost about to give up in despair,/He suddenly burst through a door/And that Mayor discovered one shirker!/Quite hidden away/In the Fairfax Apartments (Apartment 12-J)
A very small, very small shirker named Jo-Jo/Was standing, just standing, and bouncing a Yo-Yo!/Not making a sound!/Not a yipp! Not a chirp!/And the Mayor rushed inside and he grabbed the young twerp!
And he climbed with the lad up the Eiffelberg Tower./“This,” cried the Mayor,/“Is your town’s darkest hour!
The time for all Whos who have blood that is red/To come to the aid of their country!” he said./“We’ve GOT to make noises in greater amounts!/So, open your mouth, lad! For every voice counts!”
Thus he spoke as he climbed./When they got to the top,/The lad cleared his throat and he shouted out, “Yopp!”
And that Yopp…/That one small extra Yopp put it over!/Finally, at last! From that speck on that clover/Their voices were heard!/They rang out clear and clean.
And the elephant smiled./“Do you see what I mean?…/They’ve proved they ARE persons, no matter how small./And their whole world was saved by the Smallest of ALL!”
“How true! Yes, how true,” said the big Kangaroo./“And, from now on, you know what I’m planning to do?…/From now on, I’m going to protect them with you!”/And the young kangaroo in her pouch said,…/“…ME, TOO!
From sun in the summer./From rain when it’s fall-ish,/I’m going to protect them./No matter how small-ish!”
The sun did not shine./It was too wet to play./So we sat in the house/All that cold, cold, wet day.
I sat there with Sally./We sat there, we two./And I said, "How I wish/We had something to do!"
Too wet to go out/And too cold to play ball./So we sat in the house./We did nothing at all.
So all we could do was to/Sit!/Sit!/Sit!/Sit!/And we did not like it./Not one little bit.
BUMP!//And then/something went BUMP!/How that bump made us jump!
We looked!/Then we saw him step in on the mat!/We looked!/And we saw him!/The Cat in the Hat!/And he said to us,/"Why do you sit there like that?"/"I know it is wet/And the sun is not sunny./But we can have/Lots of good fun that is funny!"
"I know some good games we could play,"/Said the cat./"I know some new tricks,"/Said the Cat in the Hat./"A lot of good tricks./I will show them to you./Your mother/Will not mind at all if I do."
Then Sally and I/Did not know what to say./Our mother was out of the house/For the day.
But our fish said, "No! No!/Make that cat go away!/Tell that Cat in the Hat/You do NOT want to play./He should not be here./He should not be about./He should not be here/When your mother is out!"
"Now! Now! Have no fear./Have no fear!" said the cat./"My tricks are not bad,"/Said the Cat in the Hat./"Why, we can have/Lots of good fun, if you wish,/with a game that I call/UP-UP-UP with a fish!"
"Put me down!" said the fish./"This is no fun at all!/Put me down!" said the fish./"I do NOT wish to fall!"
"Have no fear!" said the cat./"I will not let you fall./I will hold you up high/As I stand on a ball./With a book on one hand!/And a cup on my hat!/But that is not ALL I can do!"/Said the cat…
"Look at me!/Look at me now!" said the cat./"With a cup and a cake/On the top of my hat!/I can hold up TWO books!/I can hold up the fish!/And a little toy ship!/And some milk on a dish!/And look!/I can hop up and down on the ball!/But that is not all!/Oh, no./That is not all…
"Look at me!/Look at me!/Look at me NOW!/It is fun to have fun/But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup/And the milk and the cake!/I can hold up these books!/And the fish on a rake!/I can hold the toy ship/And a little toy man!/And look! With my tail/I can hold a red fan!/I can fan with the fan/As I hop on the ball!/But that is not all./Oh, no./That is not all….
That is what the cat said…/Then he fell on his head!/He came down with a bump/From up there on the ball./And Sally and I,/We saw ALL the things fall!
And our fish came down, too./He fell into a pot!/He said, "Do I like this?"/Oh, no! I do not./This is not a good game,"/Said our fish as he lit./"No, I do not like it,/Not one little bit!"
"Now look what you did!"/Said the fish to the cat./"Now look at this house!/Look at this! Look at that!/You sank our toy ship,/Sank it deep in the cake./You shook up our house/And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here/When our mother is not./You get out of this house!"/Said the fish in the pot.
"But I like to be here./Oh, I like it a lot!"/Said the Cat in the Hat/To the fish in the pot./"I will NOT go away./I do NOT wish to go!/And so," said the Cat in the Hat,
"So/so/so…//I will show you/Another good game that I know!"
And then he ran out./And, then, fast as a fox,/The Cat in the Hat/Came back in with a box./A big red wood box./It was shut with a hook./"Now look at this trick,"/Said the cat./"Take a look!"
Then he got up on top/With a tip of his hat./"I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"/Said the cat./"In this box are two things/I will show to you now./You will like these two things,"/Said the cat with a bow.
"I will pick up the hook./You will see something new./Two things. And I call them/Thing One and Thing Two./These Things will not bite you./They want to have fun."/Then, out of the box/Came Thing Two and Thing One!/
And they ran to us fast./They said, "How do you do?/Would you like to shake hands/With Thing One and Thing Two?"
And Sally and I/Did not know what to do./So we had to shake hands/With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands./But our fish said, "No! No!/Those Things should not be/In this house! Make them go!/"They should not be here/When your mother is not!/Put them out! Put them out!"/Said the fish in the pot.
"Have no fear, little fish,"/Said the Cat in the Hat./"These Things are good Things."/And he gave them a pat./"They are tame. Oh, so tame!/They have come here to play./They will give you some fun/On this wet, wet, wet day."
"Now, here is a game that they like,"/Said the cat./"They like to fly kites,"/Said the Cat in the Hat
"No! Not in the house!"/Said the fish in the pot./"They should not fly kites/In a house! They should not./Oh, the things they will bump!/Oh, the things they will hit!/Oh, I do not like it!/Not one little bit!"
Then Sally and I/Saw them run down the hall./We saw those two Things/Bump their kites on the wall!/Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!/Down the wall in the hall.
Thing Two and Thing One!/They ran up! They ran down!/On the string of one kite/We saw Mother's new gown!/Her gown with the dots/That are pink, white and red./Then we saw one kite bump/On the head of her bed!
Then those Things ran about/With big bumps, jumps and kicks/And with hops and big thumps/And all kinds of bad tricks./And I said,/"I do NOT like the way that they play/If Mother could see this,/Oh, what would she say!"
Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"/And our fish shook with fear./"Your mother is on her way home!/Do you hear?/Oh, what will she do to us?/What will she say?/Oh, she will not like it/To find us this way!"
"So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish./"Do you hear!/I saw her. Your mother!/Your mother is near!/So, as fast as you can,/Think of something to do!/You will have to get rid of/Thing One and Thing Two!"
So, as fast as I could,/I went after my net./And I said, "With my net/I can get them I bet./I bet, with my net,/I can get those Things yet!"
Then I let down my net./It came down with a PLOP!/And I had them! At last!/Those two Things had to stop./Then I said to the cat,/"Now you do as I say./You pack up those Things/And you take them away!"
"Oh dear!" said the cat,/"You did not like our game…/Oh dear./What a shame!/What a shame!/What a shame!"
Then he shut up the Things/In the box with the hook./And the cat went away/With a sad kind of look.
"That is good," said the fish./"He has gone away. Yes./But your mother will come./She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big/And so deep and so tall,/We can not pick it up./There is no way at all!"
And THEN!/Who was back in the house?/Why, the cat!/"Have no fear of this mess,"/Said the Cat in the Hat./"I always pick up all my playthings/And so…/I will show you another/Good trick that I know!"
Then we saw him pick up/All the things that were down./He picked up the cake,/And the rake, and the gown,/And the milk, and the strings,/And the books, and the dish,/And the fan, and the cup,/And the ship, and the fish./And he put them away.
Then he said, "That is that."/And then he was gone/With a tip of his hat.
Then our mother came in/And she said to us two,/"Did you have any fun?/Tell me. What did you do?"
And Sally and I did not know/What to say./Should we tell her/The things that went on there that day?
Should we tell her about it?/Now, what SHOULD we do?/Well…/What would YOU do/If your mother asked YOU?
Every Who down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot…/But the Grinch,Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT!
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!/Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right./It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight./But I think that the most likely reason of all,/May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,/He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,/Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,/At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,/Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath./"And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,/"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,/"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
For tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,/Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!/And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!/Noise! Noise! Noise!/That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!/NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast./And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!/FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!/They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast./Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!/Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,/Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing./They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!/SING! SING! SING!/And the more the Grinch thought of this Who-Christmas-Sing,/The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
"Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"/"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!/THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat./And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat./And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"/"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"
"All I need is a reindeer…" The Grinch looked around./But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found./Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,/"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,/And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,/On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,/Toward the homes where the Whos Lay a-snooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air./All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care/When he came to the first little house on the square.
"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,/And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist./Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch./But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two./Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue./Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
"These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,/Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!/Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!/And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,/Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimbly!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!/He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash./Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee./"And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"/And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,/When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!/Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two./The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,/Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,/"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,/He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,/"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."/"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."/"I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,/And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed./And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,/HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!/Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar./On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food That he left in the house,/Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses/Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos' mouses!
It was quarter past dawn…/All the Whos, still a-bed,/All the Whos, still a-snooze/When he packed up his sled.
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!/The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!/Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,/He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
"Pooh-Pooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming./"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"/"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,/Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry Boo-Hoo!"
"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"/So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow./It started in low. Then it started to grow./But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!/It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!/Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!/Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,/Was singing! Without any presents at all!/He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!/Somehow or other, it came just the same!
And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,/Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"/"It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"/"It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore./Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!/"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."/"Maybe Christmas…perhaps…means a little bit more!"
And what happened then?/Well…in Whoville they say,/That the Grinch's small heart/Grew three sizes that day!
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,/He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,/And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!/And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!
On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond,/Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond./A nice little pond. It was clean. It was neat./The water was warm. There was plenty to eat./The turtles had everything turtles might need./And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed.
The turtles had everything turtles might need./And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed/They were… until Yertle, the king of them all,/Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.
“I’m ruler”, said Yertle, “of all that I see./But I don’t see enough. That’s the trouble with me.
With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond/But I cannot look down on the places beyond./This throne that I sit on is too, too low down./It ought to be higher!” he said with a frown.
“If I could sit high, how much greater I’d be!/What a king! I’d be ruler of all that I see!”
So Yertle the Turtle King, lifted his hand/And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command./He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone/And, using these turtles, he built a new throne.
He made each turtle stand on another one’s back/And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack./And then Yertle climbed up. He sat down on the pile./What a wonderful view! He could see ‘most a mile!
“All mine!” Yertle cried. “Oh, the things I now rule!/I’m the king of a cow! And I’m the king of a mule!/I’m the king of a house! And, what’s more, beyond that/I’m the king of a blueberry bush and a cat!
I’m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!/For I am the ruler of all that I see!”
And all through the morning, he sat up there high/Saying over and over, “A great king am I!”/Until ‘long about noon. Then he heard a faint sigh.
“What’s that?” snapped the king, and he looked down the stack./And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack./Just a part of his throne. And this plain little turtle/Looked up and he said, “Beg your pardon, King Yertle.
And this plain little turtle/Looked up and he said, “Beg your pardon, King Yertle./I’ve pains in my back and my shoulders and knees./How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?”
“SILENCE!” the King of the Turtles barked back./“I’m king, and you’re only a turtle named Mack.”/“You stay in your place while I sit here and rule./I’m the king of a cow! And I’m the king of a mule!/I’m the king of a house! And a bush! And a cat!/But that isn’t all. I’ll do better than that!
My throne shall be higher!” his royal voice thundered,/“So pile up more turtles! I want ’bout two hundred!”/“Turtles! More turtles!” he bellowed and brayed./And the turtles ‘way down in the pond were afraid./They trembled. They shook. But they came. They obeyed.
From all over the pond, they came swimming by dozens./Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins./And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack./One after another, they climbed up the stack.
Then Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high,/He could see forty miles from his throne in the sky!
“Hooray!” shouted Yertle. “I’m the king of the trees!/I’m king of the birds! And I’m king of the bees!/I’m king of the butterflies! King of the air!/Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair!
I’m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!/For I am the ruler of all that I see!”
Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack,/Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack.
“Your Majesty, please… I don’t like to complain,/But down here below, we are feeling great pain./I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,/But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights.
We turtles can’t stand it. Our shells will all crack!/Besides, we need food. We are starving!” groaned Mack.
“You hush up your mouth!” howled the mighty King Yertle./“You’ve no right to talk to the world’s highest turtle.
I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea!/There’s nothing, no, NOTHING, that’s higher than me!”
But, while he was shouting, he saw with surprise/That the moon of the evening was starting to rise/Up over his head in the darkening skies./“What’s THAT?” snorted Yertle. “Say, what IS that thing/That dares to be higher than Yertle the King?
I shall not allow it! I’ll go higher still!/I’ll build my throne higher! I can and I will!/I’ll call some more turtles. I’ll stack ‘em to heaven!/I need ’bout five thousand, six hundred and seven!”
But, as Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand/And started to order and give the command,/That plain little turtle below in the stack,/That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack,/Decided he’d taken enough. And he had.
 
And that plain little lad got a bit mad./And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing./He burped!/And his burp shook the throne of the king!
And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees,/The king of the air and the birds and the bees,/The king of a house and a cow and a mule…/Well, that was the end of the Turtle King’s rule!
For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond,/Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond!/And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,/Is King of the Mud. That is all he can see.
And the turtles, of course… all the turtles are free/As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be.
The rabbit felt pretty important that day,/On top of the hill in the sun where he lay./He felt so important up there on that hill/That he started in bragging, as animals will./And he boasted out loud as he threw out his chest:/"Of all the beasts in the world, I'm the best!
On land, on sea, even up in the sky,/No animal lives who is better than I."
"What's that?" growled a voice that was terribly gruff./"Now, why'd you say such ridiculous stuff?"/The rabbit looked down and he saw a big bear./"I'm the best of the beasts," said the bear, "and so there!"
"You're nuts," snapped the rabbit. "I'm better than you."/"Poo," the bear snorted. "Again, I say poo./You talk mighty big, Mr. Rabbit, that's true,/But how can you prove it? Just what can you do?"
"Hmm," thought the rabbit. "Now, what can I do?"/He thought and he thought, then he finally said,/"Mr. Bear, do you see these two ears on my head?/My ears are so keen and so sharp and so fine,/No ears in the world can hear further than mine."
"Humpf," the bear grunted. He looked at each ear./"You say they are good," said the bear with a sneer,/"But how do I know just how far they can hear?"
"I'll prove," said the rabbit, "my ears are the best./You sit there and watch me. I’ll prove it by test."
Then he stiffened his ears till they both stood up high/And pointed straight up at the blue of the sky./He stretched his ears open as wide as he could./"Shhh, I'm listening," he said as he stood.
He listened so hard that he started to sweat,/And the fur on his ears and his forehead got wet.
For seven long minutes he stood, then he stirred,/And he said to the bear, "Do you know what I heard?/Do you see that far mountain? It's ninety miles off./There's a fly on that mountain; I just heard him cough.
Now the cough of a fly, sir, is quite hard to hear/When he’s ninety miles off, but I heard it quite clear./So you see," bragged the rabbit, "it's perfectly true/That my ears are the best, so I’m better than you."
The bear, for a moment, just sulked as he sat,/For he knew that his ears couldn't hear things like that./"This rabbit," he thought, "made a fool out of me./Now I've got to prove that I'm better than he."
So he said to the rabbit, "You hear pretty well./You can hear ninety miles, but how far can you smell?/I'm the greatest of smellers," he bragged. "See my nose?/This nose on my face is the finest that grows.
My nose can smell anything, both far and near./With my nose, I can smell twice as far as you hear."/"You can't," snapped the rabbit. "I can," growled the bear,/And he stuck up his big nose way up high in the air.
He wiggled that nose and he sniffed and he snuffed./He waggled that nose and he whiffed and he wuffed./For more than ten minutes, he snaffed and he snuffed./Then he said to the rabbit, "I've smelled far enough."
"All right," said the rabbit, "come on now and tell,/exactly how far is the smell that you smell."
"Oh, I'm smelling a very far smell," said the bear,/"Way past that fly on the mountain up there./I'm smelling past many great mountains beyond,/Six hundred miles more to the edge of a pond.
And way, way out there by a pond you can't see/Is a very small farm. On the farm is a tree./On the very tree is a branch. On the branch is a nest,/A very small nest where two tiny eggs rest.
Two hummingbird eggs, only half an inch long,/But my nose," said the bear, "is so wonderfully strong,/My nose is so good that I smelled without fail/that the egg on the left is a little bit stale.
And that is a thing that no rabbit can do./So you see," the bear boasted, "I'm better than you.
My smeller's so keen that it just can't be beat."/"What's that?" called a voice from way down by his feet./The bear and the rabbit looked down at the sound,/And they saw an old worm crawling out of the ground.
"Now boys," said the worm, "you've been bragging a lot./You both think you're great, but I think you are not./You're not half as good as a fellow like me.
You hear and you smell, but how far can you see?/Now I'm here to prove to you big boasting guys/That your nose and your ears aren't as good as my eyes."
And the little old worm cocked his head to one side,/And he opened his eyes, and he opened them wide./And they looked far away with a strange sort of stare,/As if they were burning two holes in the air.
The eyes of the worm almost popped from his head./He stared half an hour till his eyelids got red./"That's enough," growled the bear. "Tell the rabbit and me,/How far did you look and just what did you see?"
"Well, boys," the worm answered, "that look I just took/Was a look that looked farther than you’ll ever look./I looked across the ocean way out to Japan,/For I can see further than anyone can.
There's no one on earth who has eyesight that's finer./I looked past Japan, then I looked across China./I looked across Egypt, and I took a quick glance/Across the two countries of Holland and France.
Then I looked across England and also Brazil,/But I didn't stop there; I looked much further still./And I kept right on looking and looking until/I looked 'round the world and right back to this hill.
And I saw on this hill, since my eyesight’s so keen,/The two biggest fools that have ever been seen./And the fools that I saw were none other than you,/Who seem to have nothing else better to do/Than to sit here and argue who's better than who."
And the little old worm gave his head a small jerk,/And he dived into his hole and went back to his work.
There once was a girl-bird named Gertrude McFuzz/And she had the smallest plain tail ever was./One droopy-droop feather. That's all that she had./And, oh! That one feather made Gertrude so sad.
For there was another young bird that she knew,/A fancy young birdie named Lolla-Lee-Lou,/And instead of one feather behind, she had two!
Poor Gertrude! Whenever she happened to spy/Miss Lolla-Lee-Lou flying by in the sky,/She got very jealous. She frowned. And she pouted./Then, one day she got awfully mad and she shouted:/"This just isn't fair! I have one! She has two!/I MUST have a tail just like Lolla-Lee-Lou!"
 
So she flew to her uncle, a doctor named Dake/Whose office was high in a tree by the lake/And she cried, "Uncle Doctor! Oh, please do you know/Of some kind·of a pill that will make my tail grow?"
'Tut tut!" said the doctor. "Such talk! How absurd!/Your tail is just right for your kind of a bird."
Then Gertrude had tantrums. She raised such a din/That finally her uncle, the doctor, gave in/And he told her just where she could find such a pill/On a pill-berry vine on the top of the hill.
"Oh, thank you!" chirped Gertrude McFuzz, and she flew/Right straight to the hill where the pill-berry grew.
Yes! There was the vine! And as soon as she saw it/She plucked off a berry. She started to gnaw it.
It tasted just awful. Almost made her sick./But she wanted that tail, so she swallowed it quick.
Then she felt something happen! She felt a small twitch/As if she'd been tapped, down behind, by a switch./And Gertrude looked 'round. And she cheered! It was true!/Two feathers! Exactly like Lolla-Lee-Lou!
Then she got an idea! "Now I know what I'll do,/I'll grow a tail better than Lolla-Lee-Lou!"
She felt a new twitch. And then Gertrude yelled, "WHEE!/Miss Lolla has only just two! I have three!/When Lolla-Lee-Lou sees this beautiful stuff,/She'll fall right down flat on her face, sure enough!/I'll show HER who's pretty! I certainly will!/Why, I'll make my tail even prettier still!"
"These pills that grow feathers are working just fine!"/So she nibbled another one off of the vine!
She snatched at those berries that grew on that vine./She gobbled down four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!/And she didn't stop eating, young Gertrude McFuzz,/Till she'd eaten three dozen! That's all that there was.
Then the feathers popped out! With a zang! With a zing!/They blossomed like flowers that bloom in the spring./All fit for a queen! What a sight to behold!/They sparkled like diamonds and gumdrops and gold!
All fit for a queen! What a sight to behold!/They sparkled like diamonds and gumdrops and gold!/Like silk! Like spaghetti! Like satin! Like lace!/They burst out like rockets all over the place!
They waved in the air and they swished in the breeze!/And some were as long as the branches of trees./And still they kept growing! They popped and they popped/Until, 'long about sundown when, finally, they stopped.
"And NOW," giggled Gertrude, "The next thing to do/Is to fly right straight home and show Lolla-Lee-Lou!/And when Lolla sees these, why her face will get red/And she'll let out a scream and she'll fall right down dead!"
Then she spread out her wings to take off from the ground,/But, with all of those feathers, she weighed ninety pound!/She yanked and she pulled and she let out a squawk,/But that bird couldn't fly! Couldn't run! Couldn't walk!
And all through that night, she was stuck on that hill,/And Gertrude McFuzz might be stuck up there still/If her good Uncle Dake hadn't heard the girl yelp./He rushed to her rescue and brought along help.
To lift Gertrude up almost broke all their beaks/And to fly her back home, it took almost two weeks./And then it took almost another week more/'to pull out those feathers. My, Gertrude was sore.
And, finally, when all of the pulling was done,/Gertrude, behind her, again had just one …/That one little feather she had as a starter./But now that's enough, because now she is smarter.

Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches-/Had bellies with stars./The Plain-Belly Sneetches-/Had none upon thars.
Those stars weren’t so big. They were really so small./You might think such a thing wouldn’t matter at all./But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches/Would brag, “We’re the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches.
With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they’d snort/“We’ll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!”/And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,/They’d hike right on past them without even talking.
When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,/Could a Plain-Belly get in the game…? Not at all./You only could play if your bellies had stars/And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars.
When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts/Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,/They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches./They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.
They kept them away. Never let them come near./And that’s how they treated them year after year.
Then ONE day, seems…while the Plain-Belly Sneetches/Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,/Just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars…/A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars!
“My friends,” he announced in a voice clear and keen,/“My name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean./And I’ve heard of your troubles. I’ve heard you’re unhappy./But I can fix that. I’m the Fix-it-Up Chappie.
I’ve come here to help you. I have what you need./And my prices are low. And I work at great speed./And my work is one hundred percent guaranteed!
Then, quickly Sylvester McMonkey McBean/Put together a very peculiar machine./And he said, “You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch…?/My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!”
“Just pay me your money and hop right aboard!”/So they clambered inside. Then the big machine roared/And it klonked. And it bonked. And it jerked. And it berked/And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!/They actually did. They had stars upon thars!
Then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,/“We’re exactly like you! You can’t tell us apart./We’re all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!/And now we can go to your frankfurter parties.”
“Good grief!” groaned the ones who had stars at the first./“We’re still the best Sneetches and they are the worst./But, now, how in the world will we know,” they all frowned,/“If which kind is what, or the other way round?”
Then came McBean with a very sly wink./And he said, “Things are not quite as bad as you think.
So you don’t know who’s who. That is perfectly true./But come with me, friends. Do you know what I’ll do?/I’ll make you, again, the best Sneetches on beaches/And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches.”
“Belly stars are no longer in style,” said McBean./“What you need is a trip through my Star-off Machine./This wondrous contraption will take off your stars/So you won’t look like Sneetches who have them on thars.”
And that handy machine Working very precisely/Removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely.
Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about/And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,/“We know who is who! Now there isn’t a doubt./The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!”
Then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad./To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad./Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean/Invited them into his star-off machine.
Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,/Things really got into a horrible mess.
All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,/The fix-it-up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.
Off again! On Again! In again! Out again!/Through the machines they raced round and about again,
Changing their stars every minute or two./They kept paying money. They kept running through/Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew/Whether this one was that one…or that one was this one/Or which one was what one …or what one was who.
Then, when every last cent/Of their money was spent,/The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up/And he went.
And he laughed as he drove/In his car up the beach,/“They never will learn./No. You can’t teach a Sneetch!”
But McBean was quite wrong. I’m quite happy to say/That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,/The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches/And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches
That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars/And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.
One day, making tracks/In the prairie of Prax,/Came a North-Going Zax/And a South-Going Zax.
And it happened that both of them came to a place/Where they bumped. There they stood./Foot to foot. Face to face.
"Look here, now!" the North-Going Zax said, "I say!/You are blocking my path. You are right in my way./I'm a North-Going Zax and I always go north./Get out of my way, now, and let me go forth!"
"Who's in whose way?" snapped the South-Going Zax./"I always go south, making south-going tracks./So you're in MY way! And I ask you to move/And let me go south in my south-going groove."
Then the North-Going Zax puffed his chest up with pride./"I never," he said, "take a step to one side./And I'll prove to you that I won't change my ways/If I have to keep standing here fifty-nine days!"
"And I'll prove to YOU," yelled the South-Going Zax,/"That I can stand here in the prairie of Prax/For fifty-nine years! For I live by a rule/That I learned as a boy back in South-Going School.
Never budge! That's my rule. Never budge in the least!/Not an inch to the west! Not an inch to the east!/I'll stay here, not budging! I can and I will/If it makes you and me and the whole world stand still!"
Well…/Of course the world didn't stand still. The world grew./In a couple of years, the new highway came through/And they built it right over those two stubborn Zax/And left them there, standing un-budged in their tracks.
Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave/Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?/Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.
You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo!/Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one./All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!
This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'/As you can imagine, with so many Daves.
And often she wishes that, when they were born,/She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn
And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm./And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.
And one of them Shadrack. And one of them Blinkey./And one of them Stuffy. And one of them Stinkey.
Another one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face./Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.
And one of them Ziggy. And one Soggy Muff./One Buffalo Bill. And one Biffalo Buff.
And one of them Sneepy. And one Weepy Weed./And one Paris Garters. And one Harris Tweed.
And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt/And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate …/But she didn't do it. And now it's too late.
Well…/I was walking in the night/And I saw nothing scary./For I have never been afraid/Of anything. Not very.
Then I was deep within the woods/When, suddenly, I spied them./I saw a pair of pale green pants/With nobody inside them!
I wasn’t scared. But, yet, I stopped/What could those pants be there for?/What could a pair of pants at night/Be standing in the air for?
And then they moved? Those empty pants!/They kind of started jumping./And then my heart, I must admit,/It kind of started thumping.
So I got out. I got out fast/As fast as I could go, sir./I wasn’t scared. But pants like that/I did not care for. No, sir.
After that a week went by./Then one dark night in Grin-itch/(I had to do an errand there/And fetch some Grin-itch spinach)……
Well, I had fetched the spinach./I was starting back through town/When those pants raced around a corner/And they almost knocked me down!
I lost my Grin-itch spinach/But I didn’t even care./I ran for home! Believe me,/I had really had a scare!
Now, bicycles were never made/For pale green pants to ride ‘em,/Especially spooky pale green pants/With nobody inside ‘em!
And the NEXT night, I was fishing/For Doubt-trout on Roover River/When those pants came rowing toward me!/Well, I started in to shiver.
And by now I was SO frightened/That, I’ll tell you, but I hate to…./I screamed and rowed away and lost/my hook and line and bait, too!
I ran and found a Brickle bush/I hid myself away./I got brickles in my britches/But I stayed there anyway.
I stayed all night. The next night, too/I’d be there still, no doubt,/But I had to do an errand/So, the next night, I went out.
I had to do an errand,/Had to pick a peck of Snide/In a dark and gloomy Snide-field/That was almost nine miles wide.
I said, “I do not fear those pants/With nobody inside them.”/I said, and said, and said those words./I said them. But I lied them.
Then I reached inside a Snide bush/And the next thing that I knew,/I felt my hand touch someone!/And I’ll bet that you know who.
And there I was! Caught in the Snide!/And in that dreadful place/Those spooky, empty pants and I/were standing face to face!
I yelled for help. I screamed. I shrieked./I howled. I yowled. I cried,
“OH, SAVE ME FROM THESE PALE/GREEN PANTS WITH NOBODY INSIDE!”
But then a strange thing happened./Why, those pants began to cry!/Those pants began to tremble./They were just as scared as I!
I never heard such whimpering/And I began to see/That I was just as strange to them/As they were strange to me!
So…/I put my arm around their waist/And sat right down beside them./I calmed them down./Poor empty pants/With nobody inside them.
And now, we meet quite often,/Those empty pants and I,/And we never shake or tremble,/We both smile and we say…”Hi!”
The news just came in from the county of Keck/That a very small bug by the name of Van Vleck/Is yawning so wide you can look down his neck./This may not seem very important, I know,/But it is, so I'm bothering telling you so.
A yawn is quite catching, you see, like a cough./It just takes one yawn to start other yawns off./Now the news has come in that some friends of Van Vleck's/Are yawning so wide you can look down their necks.
At this moment, right now, under seven more noses,/Great yawns are in blossom. They're blooming like roses.
The yawn of that one little bug is still spreading!/According to latest reports, it is heading/Across the wide fields, through the sleepy night air,/Across the whole country toward every-which-where.
And people are gradually starting to say,/"I feel rather drowsy. I've had quite a day."
Creatures are starting to think about rest./Two Biffer-Baum birds are now building their nest./They do it each night, and quite often I wonder/How they do this big job without making a blunder./But that is their problem, not yours and not mine./The point is: they're going to bed. And that's fine.
Sleep thoughts are spreading throughout the whole land./The time for night-brushing of teeth is at hand.
Up at Herk-Heimer Falls, where the great river rushes/And crashes down crags in great gargling gushes,/The Herk-Heimer Sisters are using their brushes./Those falls are just grand for tooth-brushing beneath/If you happen to be up that way with your teeth.
The news just came in from the castle of Krupp/That the lights are all out and the drawbridge is up.
And the old drawbridge draw-er just said with a yawn,/My drawbridge is drawn and it's going to stay drawn/'Til the milkman delivers the milk, about dawn./I'm going to bed now. So nobody better/Come round with a special delivery letter.
The number of sleepers is steadily growing./Bed is where more and more people are going.
In Culpepper Springs, in the Stilt-Walkers' Hall,/The Stilt-Walkers' stilts are all stacked on the wall./The Stilt-Walker Walkers have called it a day./They're all tuckered out and they're snoozing away.
This is very big news. It's important to know./And that's why I'm bothering telling you so.
Way out in the west, in the town of Merced,/The Hinkle-Horn Honking Club just went to bed./Every horn has been quietly hung on a hook,/For the night, in its own private Hinkle-Horn nook.
All this long, happy day, they've been honking about/And the Hinkle-Horn Honkers have honked themselves out./But they'll wake up quite fresh in the morning. And then…/They'll start right in Hinkle-Horn honking again.
Everywhere, creatures are falling asleep./The collapsible Frink just collapsed in a heap./And, by adding the Frink to the others before,/I am able to give you the who's-asleep-score:
Right now, forty thousand four hundred and four/Creatures are happily, deeply in slumber./I think you'll agree that's a whopping fine number.
Counting up sleepers…? Just how do we do it…?/Really quite simple. There's nothing much to it./We find out how many, we learn the amount/By an audio-telly-o-tally-o count.
On a mountain, halfway between Reno and Rome,/We have a machine in a plexiglass dome/Which listens and looks into everyone's home./And whenever it sees a new sleeper go flop,/It jiggles and lets a new Biggel-Ball drop.
Our chap counts these balls as they plop in a cup./And that's how we know who is down and who's up.
Do you talk in your sleep…? It's a wonderful sport/And I have some news of this sport to report./The world-champion sleep-talkers, Jo and Mo Redd-Zoff,/Have just gone to sleep and they're talking their heads off.
For fifty-five years, now, each chattering brother/Has babbled and gabbled all night to the other./They've talked about laws and they've talked about gauze./They've talked about paws and they've talked about flaws./They've talked quite a lot about old Santa Claus.
And the reason I'm telling you this is because/You should take up this sport. It's just fine for the jaws.
Do you walk in your sleep? I just had a report/Of some interesting news of this popular sport.
Near Finnigan Fen, there's a sleepwalking group/Which not only walks, but it walks a-la-hoop!/Every night they go miles. Why, they walk to such length/They have to keep eating to keep up their strength.
So, every so often, one puts down his hoop,/Stops hooping and does some quick snooping for soup./That's why they are known as the Hoop-Soup-Snoop group.
Sleepwalking, too, are the curious Crandalls/Who sleepwalk on hills with assorted-sized candles./The Crandalls walk nightly in slumbering peace/In spite of slight burns from the hot dripping grease.
The Crandalls wear candles because they walk far/And, if they wake up, want to see where they are.
Now the news has arrived from the valley of Vail/That a Chippendale Mupp has just bitten his tail,/Which he does every night before shutting his eyes./Such nipping sounds silly. But, really, it's wise.
He has no alarm clock. So this is the way/He makes sure that he'll wake at the right time of day./His tail is so long, he won't feel any pain/'Til the nip makes the trip and gets up to his brain./In exactly eight hours, the Chippendale Mupp/Will, at last, feel the bite and yell "Ouch!" and wake up.
A Mr. and Mrs. J. Carmichael Krox/Have just gone to bed near the town of Fort Knox./And they, by the way, have the finest of clocks.
I'm not at all sure that I quite quite understand/Just how the thing works, with that one extra hand.
But I do know this clock does one very slick trick./It doesn't tick tock. How it goes, is tock tick./So, with ticks in its tocker, and tocks in its ticker/It saves lots of time and the sleepers sleep quicker.
What a fine night for sleeping! From all that I hear,/It's the best night for sleeping in many a year.
They're even asleep in the Zwiebach Motel!/And people don't usually sleep there too well./The beds are like rocks and, as everyone knows,/The sheets are too short. They won't cover your toes./So, if people are actually sleeping in there…/It's a great night for sleeping! It must be the air.
It's a great night for snores! I just had a report/Of some boys who are tops in this musical sport./The snortiest snorers in all our fair land/Are Snorter McPhail and his Snore-A-Snort Band.
This band can snore Dixie and old Swanee River/So loud it would make forty elephants shiver.
The loudest of all the boys is McPhail./He snores with his head in a three-gallon pail./So they snore in a cave twenty miles out of town./If they snored closer in, they would snore the town down.
Do you know who's asleep out in Foona-Lagoona…?/Two very nice Foona-Lagoona Baboona./We've added them into our who's-asleep count/Which has grown to a really amazing amount./Exactly eight million, eight hundred and eight/Creatures are sleeping now! Isn't that great!
A Jedd is in bed, and the bed of a Jedd/Is the softest of beds in the world, it is said./He makes it from pom poms he grows on his head./And he's sleeping right now on the softest of fluff,/Completely exhausted from growing the stuff.
The news has come in from the district of Dofft/That two Offt are asleep and they're sleeping aloft./And how are they able to sleep off the ground…?/I'll tell you. I weighed one last week and I found/That an Offt is so light he weighs minus one pound!
A Moose is asleep. He is dreaming of Moose drinks./A Goose is asleep. He is dreaming of Goose drinks./That's well and good when a Moose dreams of Moose juice./And nothing goes wrong when a Goose dreams of Goose juice.
But it isn't too good when a Moose and a Goose/Start dreaming they're drinking the other one's juice./Moose juice, not Goose juice, is juice for a Moose/And Goose juice, not Moose juice, is juice for a Goose.
So, when Goose gets a mouthful of juices of Moose's/And Moose gets a mouthful of juices of Goose's/They always fall out of their beds screaming screams./So… I'm warning you, now! Never drink in your dreams.
Speaking of dreaming, I think you should note/That the Bumble-Tub Club is now dreaming afloat./Every night they go dreaming down Bumble-Tub Creek/Except for one night, every third or fourth week,/When they stop for repairs. ‘Cause their Bumble-Tubs leak.
But tonight they're afloat, full of dreams, full of bliss,/And that's why I'm bothering telling you this.
At the fork of a road in the Vale of Va-Vode/Five foot-weary salesmen have laid down their load./All day they've raced round in the heat, at top speeds,/Unsuccessfully trying to sell Zizzer-Zoof seeds/Which nobody wants because nobody needs.
Tomorrow will come. They'll go back to their chore./They'll start on the road, Zizzer-Zoofing once more/But tonight they've forgotten their feet are so sore,/And that's what the wonderful night time is for.
Everywhere, creatures have shut off their voices./They've all gone to bed in the beds of their choices.
They're sleeping in bushes. They're sleeping in crannies./Some on their stomachs, and some on their fannies./They're peacefully sleeping in comfortable holes./Some, even, on soft-tufted barber shop poles.
The number of sleepers is now past the millions!/The number of sleepers is now in the billions!/They're sleeping on steps! And on strings! And on floors!/In mailboxes, ships, and the keyholes of doors!
Every worm on a fishhook is safe for the night./Every fish in the sea is too sleepy to bite./Every whale in the ocean has turned off his spout./Every light between here and far Foodle is out.
And now, adding things up, we are way beyond billions!/Our who's-asleep-score is now up in the zillions!/Ninety-nine zillion, nine trillion and two/Creatures are sleeping! So… how about you?/When you put out your light, then the number will be/Ninety-nine zillion nine trillion and three.

At the far end of town/where the Grickle-grass grows/and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows/and no birds ever sing excepting old crows…/is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.
And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say,/if you look deep enough you can still see, today,/where the Lorax once stood/just as long as it could/before somebody lifted the Lorax away.
What was the Lorax?/And why was it there?/And why was it lifted and taken somewhere/from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows?/The old Once-ler still lives here./Ask him. He knows.
You won't see the Once-ler./Don't knock at his door./He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store./He lurks in his Lerkim, cold under the roof,/where he makes his own clothes/out of miff-muffered moof.
And on special dank midnights in August,/he peeks/out of the shutters/and sometimes he speaks/and tells how the Lorax was lifted away./He'll tell you, perhaps…/if you're willing to pay.
On the end of a rope/he lets down a tin pail/and you have to toss in fifteen cents/and a nail/and the shell of a great-great-great-/grandfather snail.
Then he pulls up the pail,/makes a most careful count/to see if you've paid him/the proper amount./Then he hides what you paid him/away in his Snuvv,/his secret strange hole/in his gruvvulous glove.
Then he grunts, "I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone,/for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone."
SLUPP!/Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear/and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,/since they have to come down/through a snergelly hose,/and he sounds/as if he had/smallish bees up his nose.
"Now I'll tell you,"he says, with his teeth sounding gray,/"how the Lorax got lifted and taken away…
It all started way back…/such a long, long time back…/Way back in the days when the grass was still green/and the pond was still wet/and the clouds were still clean,/and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space…/one morning, I came to this glorious place.
And I first saw the trees!/The Truffula Trees!/The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees!/Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.
And, under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots/frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits/as they played in the shade and ate Truffula fruits.
From the rippulous pond/came the comfortable sound/of the Humming-Fish humming/while splashing around.
But those trees! Those trees!/Those Truffula Trees!/All my life I'd been searching/for trees such as these./The touch of their tufts/was much softer than silk./And they had the sweet smell/of fresh butterfly milk.
I felt a great leaping/of joy in my heart./I knew just what I'd do!/I unloaded my cart.
In no time at all, I had built a small shop./Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop./And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,/I took the soft tuft, and I knitted a Thneed!
The instant I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump!/I looked./I saw something pop out of the stump/of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man./Describe him?… That's hard. I don't know if I can.
He was shortish. And oldish./And brownish. And mossy./And he spoke with a voice/that was sharpish and bossy./"Mister!" he said with a sawdusty sneeze,/"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.
I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues./And I'm asking you, sir, at the top if my lungs"-/he was very upset as he shouted and puffed-/"What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?"
"Look, Lorax," I said."There's no cause for alarm./I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm./I'm being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed./A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!
It's a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove, It's a hat./But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that./You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!/Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!"
The Lorax said,/"Sir! You are crazy with greed./There is no one on earth/who would buy that fool Thneed!"
But the very next minute I proved he was wrong./For, just at that minute, a chap came along,/and he thought the Thneed I had knitted was great./He happily bought it for three ninety-eight
I laughed at the Lorax, "You poor stupid guy!/You never can tell what some people will buy."
"I repeat," cried the Lorax,/"I speak for the trees!"/"I'm busy," I told him./"Shut up, if you please."
I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all,/built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts/and I said, "Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance/for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!/Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch./Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch."
And, in no time at all,/in the factory I built,/the whole Once-ler Family/was working full tilt./We were all knitting Thneeds/just as busy as bees,/to the sound of the chopping/of Truffula Trees.
Then…/Oh! Baby! Oh!/How my business did grow!/Now, chopping one tree/at a time/was too slow./So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker/which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.
We were making Thneeds/four times as fast as before!/And that Lorax?…/He didn't show up any more./But the next week/he knocked/on my new office door.
He snapped, "I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees/which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots/who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits/and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.
"NOW… thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,/there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round./And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies/because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!
"They loved living here. But I can't let them stay./They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may./Good luck, boys," he cried. And he sent them away.
I, the old Once-ler, felt sad/as I watched them all go./BUT…/business is business!/And business must grow/regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.
I meant no harm. I most truly did not./But I had to grow bigger.So bigger I got.
I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads./I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads/of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth/to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!
I went right on biggering… selling more Thneeds./And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes/when that old-nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.
"I am the Lorax," he coughed and he whiffed./He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed./"Once-ler!" he cried with a cruffulous croak./"Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!/My poor Swomee-Swans… why, they can't sing a note!/No one can sing who has smog in his throat.
"And so," said the Lorax,/"-please pardon my cough-/they cannot live here./So I'm sending them off./"Where will they go?…/I don't hopefully know./They may have to fly for a month… or a year…/To escape from the smog you've smogged up around here.
"What's more," snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)/"Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp./Your machine chugs on, day and night without stop/making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp.
And what do you do with this leftover goo?…/I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!/"You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!/No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed.
So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary./They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary/in search of some water that isn't so smeary."
And then I got mad./I got terribly mad./I yelled at the Lorax, "Now listen here, Dad!/All you do is yap-yap and say, 'Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!'
Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you/I intend to go on doing just what I do!/And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering/On biggering/and BIGGERING/and BIGGERING/and BIGGERING,/turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneeds/which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!"
And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!/From outside in the fields came a sickening smack/of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall./The very last Truffula Tree of them all!
No more trees. No more Thneeds. No more work to be done./So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,/all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars/and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.
Now all that was left 'neath the bad smelling-sky/was my big empty factory…/the Lorax…/and I.
The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance…/just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance…/as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.
And I'll never forget the grim look on his face/when he heisted himself and took leave of this place,/through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.
And all that the Lorax left here in this mess/was a small pile of rocks, with one word…/"UNLESS."/Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.
That was long, long ago./But each day since that day/I've sat here and worried/and worried away.
Through the years, while my buildings/have fallen apart,/I've worried about it/with all of my heart.
"But now," says the Once-ler,/"Now that you're here,/the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear./UNLESS someone like you/cares a whole awful lot,/nothing is going to get better./It's not.
"SO…/Catch!" calls the Once-ler./He lets something fall./"It's a Truffula Seed./It's the last one of all!
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds./And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs./Plant a new Truffula.Treat it with care./Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air./Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack./Then the Lorax/and all of his friends/may come back."
The time has come./The time has come./The time is now.///Just go. Go. GO!/I don't care how.///You can go by foot./You can go by cow./Marvin K. Mooney, will you please go now!
You can go on skates./You can go on skis./You can go in a hat./But please go. Please!
I don't care./You can go by bike./You can go on a Zike-Bike if you like./If you like you can go in an old blue shoe.
Just go, go, GO!/Please do, do, DO!
Marvin K. Mooney,/I don't care how./Marvin K. Mooney,/Will you please GO NOW!
You can go on stilts./You can go by fish./You can go in a Crunk-Car if you wish.
If you wish you may go by lion's tail./Or stamp yourself and go by mail./Marvin K. Mooney!/Don't you know the time has come to go, Go, GO!
Get on your way!/Please, Marvin K.!/You might like going/In a Zumble-Zay.
You can go by balloon…/… or broomstick./OR/You can go by camel in a bureau drawer.
You can go by Bumble-Boat…/… or jet./I don't care how you go.
Get yourself a Ga-Zoom./You can go with a……. BOOM!/Marvin, Marvin, Marvin!/Will you leave this room!
Marvin K. Mooney!/I don't care HOW./Marvin K. Mooney!/Will you please GO NOW!
I said GO and GO I meant…/The time had come./SO… Marvin WENT.
When I was quite young/and quite small for my size,/I met an old man in the Desert of Drize./And he sang me a song I will never forget./At least, well, I haven't forgotten it yet.
He sat in a terribly prickly place./But he sang with a sunny sweet smile on his face:/When you think things are bad,/when you feel sour and blue,/when you start to get mad . ./you should do what I do!
Just tell yourself, Duckie,/you're really quite lucky!/Some people are much more/oh, ever so much more . ./oh, muchly much-much more/unlucky than you!
Be glad you don't work on the Bunglebung Bridge/that they're building across Boober Bay at Bumm Ridge.
It's a troublesome world./All the people who're in it are troubled with troubles almost every minute.
You ought to be thankful, a whole heaping lot,/for the places and people you're lucky you're not!
Just suppose, for example,/you lived in Ga-Zayt/and got caught in that traffic/on Zayt Highway Eight!
Or suppose,/just for instance,/you lived in Ga-Zair/with your bedroom up here/and your bathroom up THERE!
Suppose, just suppose, you were poor Herbie Hart,/who has taken his Throm-dim-bu-lator apart!/He never will get it together, I'm sure./He never will know if the Gick or the Goor/fits into the Skrux or the Snux or the Snoor.
Yes, Duckie, you're lucky you're not Herbie Hart/who has taken his Throm-dim-bu-lator apart.
Think they work you too hard … ? Think of poor Ali Sard!/He has to mow grass in his uncle's backyard/and it's quick-growing grass/and it grows as he mows it./The faster he mows it, the faster he grows it.
And all that his stingy old uncle will pay/for his shoving that mower around in that hay/is the piffulous pay of two Dooklas a day.
And Ali can't live on such piffulous pay!/So…/He has to paint flagpoles/on Sundays in Grooz./How lucky you are you don't live in his shoes!
And poor Mr. Bix!/Every morning at six,/poor Mr. Bix has his Borfin to fix!
It doesn't seem fair. It just doesn't seem right,/but his Borfin just seems to go shlump every night.
It shlumps in a heap, sadly needing repair./Bix figures it's due to the local night air./It takes him all day to un-shlump it. And then . ./the night air comes back/and it shlumps once again!
So don't you feel blue. Don't get down in the dumps/You're lucky you don't have a Borfin that shlumps.
And, while we are at it, consider the Schlottz,/the Crumple-horn, Web-footed, Green-bearded Schlottz,/whose tail is entailed with un-solvable knots./If he isn't muchly/more worse off than you,/I'll eat my umbrella./That's just what I'll do.
And you're lucky, indeed, you don't ride on a camel/To ride on a camel, you sit on a wamel./A wamel, you know, is a sort of a saddle/held on by a button that's known as a faddle./And, boy! If your old wamel-faddle gets loose,/I'm telling you, Duckie, you're gone like a goose.
And poor Mr. Potter,/T-crosser,/I-dotter./He has to cross t's and he has to dot i's in an I-and-T factory/out in Van Nuys!
Oh, the jobs people work at! Out west, near Hawtch-Hawtch,/there's a Hawtch-Hawtcher Bee-Watcher./His job is to watch . ./is to keep both his eyes on the lazy town bee./A bee that is watched will work harder, you see.
Well … he watched and he watched./But, in spite of his watch,/that bee didn't work any harder. Not mawtch./So then somebody said,/"Our old bee-watching man/just isn't bee-watching as hard as he can./He ought to be watched by another Hawtch-Hawtcher!/The thing that we need/is a Bee-Watcher-Watcher
WELL…/The Bee-Watcher-Watcher watched the Bee-Watcher./He didn't watch well. So another Hawtch-Hawtcher/had to come in as a Watch-Watcher-Watcher!
And today all the Hawtchers who live in Hawtch-Hawtch/are watching on Watch-Watcher-Watchering-Watch,/Watch-Watching the Watcher who's watching that bee./You're not a Hawtch-Watcher. You're lucky, you see!
And how fortunate you're not Professor de Breeze/who has spent the past thirty-two years, if you please,/trying to teach Irish ducks how to read Jivvanese.
And think of the/poor puffing Poogle-Horn Players,/who have to parade/down the Poogle-Horn Stairs/every morning to wake up/the Prince of Poo-Boken./It's awful how often/their poogles get broken!
And, oh! Just suppose/you were poor Harry Haddow./Try as he will./he can't make any shadow!/He thinks that, perhaps, something's wrong with his Gizz./And I think that, by golly, there probably is.
And the Brothers Ba-zoo./The poor Brothers Ba-zoo!/Suppose your hair grew/like theirs happened to do!
You think you're unlucky … ? I'm telling you, Duckie,/some people are muchly,/oh, ever so muchly,/muchly more-more-more unlucky than you!
And suppose that you lived in that forest in France,/where the average young person just hasn't a chance/to escape from the perilous pants-eating-plants!
But your pants are safe! You're a fortunate guy./And you ought to be shouting, "How lucky am I!"
And, speaking of plants,/you should be greatly glad-ish/you're not Farmer Falkenberg's/seventeenth radish.
And you're so, so lucky/you're not Gucky Gown,/who lives by himself/ninety miles out of town,/in the Ruins of Ronk./Ronk is rather run-down.
Thank goodness for all of the things you are not!/Thank goodness you're not something someone forgot,/and left all alone in some punkerish place/like a rusty tin coat hanger hanging in space.
That's why I say, "Duckie!/Don't grumble! Don't stew!/Some critters are much-much,/oh, ever so much-much,/so muchly much-much more unlucky than you!"
On the last day of summer, ten hours before Fall,/My grandfather took me out to the wall/./For a while he stood silent. Then finally he said,/With a very sad shake of his very old head,/“As you know, on this side of the Wall we are Yooks./On the far other side of this Wall live the Zooks.”
Then my grandfather said, “It’s high time that you knew/Of the terribly horrible thing that Zooks do./In every Zook house and in every Zook town/Every Zook eats his bread with the butter side down!”
“But we Yooks, as you know, when we breakfast or sup,/Spread our bread,” Grandpa said, “with the butter side up./That’s the right, honest way!” Grandpa gritted his teeth./“So you can’t trust a Zook who spreads bread underneath!
Every Zook must be watched! He has kinks in his soul!/That’s why, as a youth, I made watching my goal,/Watching Zooks for the Zook-Watching Border Patrol!
In those days, of course, the Wall wasn’t so high/And I could look any Zook square in the eye./If he dared to come close I could give him a twitch/With my tough tufted prickly Snick-Berry Switch.
For a while that worked fine. All the Zooks stayed away/And our country was safe. Then one terrible day/A very rude Zook by the name of Van Itch/Snuck up and slingshotted my Snick-Berry Switch!
With my broken-off switch, with my head hung in shame,/To the Chief Lookeroo in great sorrow I came./But our leader just smiled. He said, “You’re not to blame./And those Zooks will be sorry they started this game.
We’ll dress you right up in a fancier suit!/We’ll give you a fancier slingshot to shoot!”
And he ordered the Boys in the Back Room to figure/How to build me some sort of triple-sling jigger./With my Triple-Sling Jigger I sure felt much bigger./I marched to the Wall with great vim and great vigor,/Right up to VanItch with my hand on the trigger.
“I’ll have no more nonsense,” I said with a frown,/“From Zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!”/Van Itch looked quite sickly. He ran off quite quickly.
I’m unhappy to say he came back the next day/In a spiffy new suit with a big new machine,/And he snarled as he said, looking frightfully mean,
“You may fling those hard rocks with your Triple-Sling Jigger./But I, also, now have my hand on a trigger!/My wonderful weapon, the Jigger-Rock Snatchem,/Will fling ‘em right back just as quick as we catch ‘em.
We’ll have no more nonsense. We’ll take no more gupp/From you Yooks who eat bread with the butter side up!”
“I have failed, sir,” I sobbed as I made my report/To the Chief Yookeroo in the headquarters fort./He just laughed. “You’ve done nothing at all of the sort./Our slingshots have failed. That was old-fashioned stuff./Slingshots, dear boy, are not modern enough.
All we need is some newfangled kind of gun./My Boys in the Back Room have already begun/To think up a walloping whiz-zinger one!/My Bright Boys are thinking. They’re on the right track./They’ll think one up quick and we’ll send you right back!”
They thought up a great one! They certainly did./They thought up a gun called the Kick-a-Poo Kid/Which they loaded with powerful Poo-a-Doo Powder/And ant’s eggs and bees’ legs and dried-fried clam chowder.
And they carefully trained a real smart dog named Daniel/To serve as our country’s first gun-toting spaniel.
Then Daniel, the Kick-a-Poo Spaniel, and I/Marched back toward the Wall with our heads held up high/While everyone cheered and their cheers filled the sky;/“Fight! Fight for the Butter Side Up! Do or die!”
Well…/We didn’t do. And we didn’t quite die./But we sure did get worsted, poor Daniel and I.
Van Itch was there too! And he said, the old pig,/“The Boys in my Back Room invented this rig/Called the Eight-Nozzled, Elephant-Toted Boom-Blitz./It shoots high-explosive sour cherry stone pits/And will put your dumb Kick-a-Poo Kid on the fritz!”
Poor Daniel and I were scared out of our witz!/Once more, by Van Itch I was bested and beat./Once again I limped home from the Wall in defeat.
I dragged and I sagged and my spirits were low,/As low as I thought that they ever could go,/When I heard a Boom-Bah! And a Diddle-dee-Dill!/And our Butter-Up Band marched up over the Hill!
The Chief Yookeroo had sent them to meet me/Along with the Right-Side-Up Song Girls to greet me./They sang: “Oh, be faithful! Believe in thy butter!”/And they lifted my spirits right out of the gutter!
“My boy,” smiled the Chief Yookeroo, “we’ve just voted/And made you a general! You’ve been promoted./Your pretty new uniform’s ready. Get in it!/The Big War is coming. You’re going to begin it!
And what’s more, this time you are certain to win it./“My Boys in the Back Room have finally found how./Just wait till you see what they’ve puttered up now!/In their great new machine you’ll fly over that Wall/And clobber those Butter-Down Zooks one and all!”
Those Boys in the Back Room sure knew how to putter!/They made me a thing called the Utterly Sputter/And I jumped aboard with my heart all aflutter/And steered toward the land of the Upside-Down Butter.
This machine was so modern, so frightfully new,/No one knew quite exactly just what it would do!/But it had several faucets that sprinkled Blue Goo/Which, somehow, would sprinkle the Zooks as I flew/And gum up that upside-down butter they chew.
I was racing pell-mell when I heard a voice yell,/“If you sprinkle us Zooks, you’ll get sprinkled as well!”/Van Itch had a Sputter exactly like mine!
And he yelled, “My Blue-Gooer is working just fine!/And I’m here to say that if Yooks can goo Zooks,/You’d better forget it. ‘Cause Zooks can goo Yooks!”
I flew right back home and, as you may have guessed,/I was downright despondent, disturbed, and depressed.
And I saw, just as soon as I stepped back on land,/So were all of the girls of the Butter-Up Band./The Chief Drum Majorette, Miz Yookie-Ann Sue, said,/“That was a pretty sour flight that you flew.
And the Chief Yookeroo has been looking for you!”/I raced to his office. The place was a sight./“Have no fears,” said the Chief. “Everything is all right.
My Bright Back Room Boys have been brighter than bright./They’ve thought up a gadget that’s Newer than New./It is filled with mysterious Moo-Lacka-Moo/And can blow all those Zooks clear to Sala-ma-goo./THEY’VE INVENTED THE BITSY BIG-BOY BOOMEROO!
“You just run to the wall like a nice little man./Drop this bomb on the Zooks just as fast as you can./I have ordered all Yooks to stay safe underground/While the Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo is around.”
As I raced for that Wall, with the bomb in my hand,/I noticed that every last Yook in our land/Was obeying our Chief Yookeroo’s grim command./They were all bravely marching, with banners aflutter,/Down a hole! For their country! And Right-Side-Up Butter!
That’s when Grandfather found me! He grabbed me. He said,/“You should be down that hole! And you’re up here instead!/But perhaps this is all for the better, somehow./You will see me make history! RIGHT HERE! AND RIGHT NOW!
Grandpa leapt up that Wall with a lopulous leap/And he cleared his hoarse throat with a bopulous beep./He screamed, “Here’s the end of that terrible town/Full of Zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!”
And at the very instant we heard a klupp-klupp/Of feet on the Wall and old Van Itch klupped up!/The Boys in HIS Back Room had made him one too!/In his fist was another Big-Boy Boomeroo!/“I’ll blow you,” he yelled, “into pork and wee beans!/I’ll butter-side-up you to small smithereens!”
“Grandpa!” I shouted. “Be careful! Oh, gee!/Who’s going to drop it? Will you…? Or will he…?/“Be patient,” said Grandpa. “We’ll see. We will see…”
I wish we could do what they do in Katroo./They sure know how to say “Happy Birthday to You!” 
In Katroo, every year, on the day you were born/They start the day right in the bright early morn /When the Birthday Honk-Honker hikes high up Mount Zorn /And lets loose a big blast on the big Birthday Horn. 
And the voice of the Horn calls out loud as it plays:/“Wake up! For today is your Day of all Days 
Then, the moment the Horn’s happy honk-honk is heard/Comes a fluttering flap-flap! And then comes THE BIRD!/The Great Birthday Bird! And, so far as I know,/Katroo is the only place Birthday Birds grow. 
This bird has a brain. He’s most beautifully brained/With the brainiest bird brain that’s ever been trained. 
He was trained by the most famous club in this nation,/The Katroo Happy Birthday Assoseeeyeation./And, whether you name is Pete, Polly or Paul,/When your birthday comes round, he’s in charge of it all! 
And whether your name is Nate, Nelly or ned,/He knows your address, and he heads for your bed. 
You hear a soft swoosh in the brightening sky./You’re not all awake but you open one eye. 
Then over the housetops and trees of Katroo,/You see that bird coming! To you. Just to you! 
That bird pops right in! You are up on your feet!/You jump to the window! You meet and you greet/With the Secret Katroo Birthday Hi-Sign-And-Shake/That only good people with birthdays may make. 
You do it just so. With each finger and toe./Then the Bird says, “Come on! Brush your teeth and let’s go!/It’s your Day of all Days! It’s the Best of the Best!/So don’t waste a minute! Hop to it! Get dressed! 
And five minutes later, you’re having a snack/On your way out of town on a Smorasbord’s back. 
“Today,” laughs the Bird, “eat whatever you want./Today no one tells you you cawnt and you shawnt. 
And, today, you don’t have to be tidy or neat./If you wish, you may eat with both hands and both feet. 
So get in there and munch. Have a big muncheroo! 
Today is your birthday! Today you are you! 
/If we didn’t have birthdays, you wouldn’t be you./If you’d never been born, well then what would you do? 
If you’d never been born, well then what would you be?/You might be a fish! Or a toad in a tree!/You might be a doorknob! Or three baked potatoes!/You might be a bag full of hard green tomatoes! 
Or worse than all that… Why you might be a WASN’T!/A Wasn’t has no fun at all. No, he doesn’t./A Wasn’t just isn’t. He just isn’t present./But you… you ARE YOU! And, now isn’t that pleasant! 
So we’ll go to the top of the toppest blue space,/The Official Katroo Birthday Sounding-Off Place! 
Come on! Open your mouth and sound off at the sky!/Shout loud at the top of your voice, “I AM I! 
ME! I am I! And I may not know why/But I know that I like it. Three cheers! I AM I!” 
And now, on this day of all days in Katroo,/The assoseeeyeation has built just for you/A railway with very particular boats/That are pulled through the air by Funicular Goats. 
These goats never trip, never slip, never bungle./They’ll take you down fast to the Birthday Flower Jungle. 
The best-sniffing flowers that anyone grows/We have grown to be sniffed by your own private nose. 
They smell like licorice! And cheese! 
Send forty Who-Bubs up the trees/To snip with snippers! Nip with nippers!/Clip and clop with clapping clippers./Nip and snip with clipping cloppers!/Snip and snop with snipping snoppers! 
All for you the Who-Bubs clip!/Happy Birthday! Nop and nip! 
Then pile the wondrous smelling stacks/On fifty Hippo-Heimers’ backs!/They’ll take these flowers all home for you./You can keep the Hippo-Heimers too. 
While this is done, I’ve got a hunch/It’s time to eat our Birthday Lunch… 
For Birthday Lunches as a rule/We serve hot dogs rolled on a spool./So stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff/And stuff until you’ve had enough. 
Now, of course, we’re all mustard, so, one of the rules/Is to wash it all of in the Mustard-Off Pools/Which are very fine warm-water mountaintop tubs/Which were built, just for this, by the Mustard-Off Clubs. 
The, out of the water! Sing loud while you dry!/Sing loud, “I am lucky!” Sing loud, “I am I!” 
If you’d never been born, then you might be an isn’t./An isn’t has no fun at all. No he disn’t./He never has birthdays, and that isn’t pleasant./You have to be born, or you don’t get a present. 
A present! Aha! Now what kind shall I give?/Why the kind you’ll remember as long as you live! 
Would you like a fine pet? Well, that’s just what you’ll get./I’ll get you the fanciest pet ever yet! 
As you see we have here in the heart of our nation/The Official Katroo Birthday Pet Reservation./From east of the eastest to west of the westest/We’ve searched the whole world just to bring you the bestest. 
They come in all sizes… small, medium, tall./If you wish, I will find you the tallest of all! 
To find who’s the tallest, we start with the smallest…/We start with the smallest. Then what do we do?/We line them up. Back to back. Two by two./Taller and taller. And, when we are through,/We finally will find one who’s taller than who. 
But you have to be smart and keep watching their feet./Because sometimes they stand on their tiptoes and cheat. 
And so, from the smaller, we stack them up taller/And taller and taller and taller and taller./And now! Here’s the one who is taller than all-er! 
He’s yours! He’s all yours. He’s the very top tallest./I know you’ll enjoy him, the tallest of allest./I’ll have him shipped home to you Birthday Express./That costs quite a lot but I couldn’t care less. 
Today is your birthday! Today You are You!/So what if it costs me a thousand or two. 
Today is your birthday. You get what you wish./You might also like a nice Time-Telling Fish. 
So I’ll send Diver Getz and I’ll send Diver Gitz/Deep under the sea with their undersea kits./In all the wide world there are no better pets/Than the Time-Telling Fish that Gitz gits and Getz gets. 
But speaking of time… Why good gracious alive!/That Time-Telling Fish says it’s quarter to five! 
I had no idea it was getting so late!/We’ve got to get going! We have a big date! 
And so as the sunset burns red in the west,/Comes the night of the Day-of-the-Best-of-the-Best! 
The Night-of-all-Nights-of-all-Nights in Katroo!/So, according to rule, what we usually do/Is saddle up two Hooded Klopfers named Alice/And gallop like mad to the Birthday Pal-alace. 
Your Big Birthday Party soon starts to begin/In the finest Pal-alace you’ve ever been in! 
Now this Birthday Pal-alace, as soon you will see,/Has exactly nine thousand four hundred and three/Rooms to play games in! Twelve halls for brass bands!/Not counting the fifty-three hamburger stands. 
And besides all of that, there are sixty-five rooms/Just for keeping the Sweeping-Up-Afterwards-Brooms./Because, after your party, as well you may guess,/It will take twenty days just to sweep up the mess. 
First, we’re greeted by Drummers who drum as they come./And next come the Strummers who strum as they come./And the Drummers who drum and the Strummers who strum/Are followed by Zummers who come as the zum. 
Just look at those Zummers! They’re sort of like Plumbers./They come along humming, with heads in their plumbing/And that makes the music that Zummers call zumming! 
And all of this beautiful zumming and humming/And strumming and drumming and coming…/All of it, all of it, all is for you! 
LOOK! Dr. Derring’s Singing Herrings!/Derring’s Singing, Spelling Herrings!/See what Derring’s Herrings do!/They sing and spell it! All for you! 
And here comes your cake, cooked by Snookers and Snookers,/The Official Katroo Happy Birthday Cake Cookers./And Snookers and Snookers, I’m happy to say,/Are the only cake cookers who cook cakes today/Made of guaranteed, certified, strictly Grade A/Peppermint cucumber sausage-paste butter! 
And the world’s finest cake slicers, Dutter and Dutter/And Dutter and Dutter, with hatchets a-flutter,/High up on the poop deck, stand ready to cut her. 
Today you are you! That is truer that true!/There is no one alive who is you-er than you! 
Shout loud, “I am lucky to be what I am!/Thank goodness I’m not just a clam or a ham/Or a dusty old jar of sour gooseberry jam! 
I am what I am! That’s a great thing to be!/If I say so myself, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!” 
Now, by Horseback and Bird-back and Hiffer-back, too,/Come your friends! All your friends! From all over Katroo!/And the Birthday Pal-alace heats up with hot friends/And your party goes on! On and on till it ends. 
And when it all ends you’re much happier, richer and fatter./And the Bird flies you home on a very soft platter./So that’s what the Birthday Bird does in Katroo./And I wish I could do all these great things for you!
This was no time for play./This was no time for fun./This was no time for games./There was work to be done.
All that deep,/Deep, deep snow,/All that snow had to go./When our mother went/Down to the town for the day,/She said, “Somebody has to/Clean all this away./Somebody, somebody/Has to, you see.”/Then she picked out two Somebodies./Sally and me. 
Well . . ./There we were./We were working like that/And then who should come up/But the cat in the hat! 
“Oh-oh!” Sally said./“Don’t you talk to that cat./That cat is a bad one,/That Cat in the Hat.
He plays lots of bad tricks./Don’t you let him come near./You know what he did/The last time he was here.”
“Play tricks?” laughed the cat./“Oh, my my! No, no, no!/I just want to go in/To get out of the snow.
Keep your mind on your work./You just stay there, you two./I will go in the house/And find something to do.” 
Then that cat went right in!/He was up to no good!/So I ran in after/Do you know where I found him?/You know where he was?/He was eating a cake in the tub!/Yes he was!
The hot water was on/And the cold water, too./And I said to the cat,/“What a bad thing to do!”
“But I like to eat cake/In a tub,” laughed the cat./“You should try it some time,”/Laughed the cat as he sat. 
And then I got mad./This was no time for fun./I said, “Cat! You get out!/There is work to be done.
I have no time for tricks./I must go back and dig./I can’t have you in here/Eating cake like a pig!
You get out of this house!/We don’t want you about!”/Then I shut off the water/And let it run out.
The water ran out./And then I saw the ring!/A ring in the tub!/And, oh boy! What a thing!/A big long pink cat ring!/It looked like pink ink!/And I said, “Will this ever/Come off? I don’t think!”  
“Have no fear of that ring,”/Laughed the Cat in the Hat./“Why, I can take cat rings/Off tubs. Just like that!/Do you know how he did it?/with mother’s white dress!/Now the tub was all clean,/But her dress was a mess!
Then Sally looked in./Sally saw the dress, too!/And Sally and I/Did not know what to do./We should work in the snow./But that dress! What a spot!/“It may never come off!”/Sally said. “It may not!”
But the cat laughed, “Ho! Ho!/I can make the spot go./The way I take spots off a dress/Is just so!” 
“See here!” laughed the cat./“It is not hard at all./The thing that takes spots/Off a dress is a wall!”
Then we saw the cat wipe/The spot off the dress./Now the dress was all clean./But the wall! What a mess!
“Oh, wall spots!” he laughed./“Let me tell you some news./To take spots off a wall,/All I need is two shoes!”
Whose shoes did he use?/I looked and saw whose!/And I said to the cat,/“This is very bad news./Now the spot is all over/dad’s $10 shoes!” 
Laughed the Cat in the Hat./“His $10 shoes will have/No spots at all./I will rub them right off/On this rug in the hall.”
“But now we have rug spots!’/I yelled. “What a day!/Rug spots! What next?/Can you take them away?” 
“Don’t ask me,” he laughed./“Why, you know that I can!”/Then he picked up the rug/And away the cat ran.
“I can clean up these rug spots/Before you count three!/No spots are too hard for Hat Cat like me”
He ran into Dad’s bedroom/And then the cat said,/“It is good that your dad/Has the right kind of bed.”
Then he shook the rug! CRACK!/Now the bed had the spot!/And all I could sayF was,/“Now what, Cat?/now what?”
But the cat just stood still./He just looked at the bed./“This is not the right kind of a bed,”/The cat said.
“To take spots off this bed/Will be hard,” said the cat./“I can’t do it alone,”/Said the Cat in the Hat.
“It is good I have some one/To help me,” he said./“Right here in my hat/On the top of my head!
It is good that I have him/Here with me today. `/He helps me a lot./This is Little Cat A.”/And then Little Cat A/Took the hat off his head./“It is good I have some one/To help me,” he said./“This is Little Cat B./And I keep him about,/And when I need help/Then I let him come out.”  
And then B said,/“I think we need Little Cat C./That spot is too much/For the A cat and me./But now, have no fear!/We will clean it away!/The three of us! Little Cats B, C and A !”
“Come on! Take it away!”/Yelled Little Cat A./“I will hit that old spot/With this broom! Do you see? 
It goes off the old bed!/It goes on the T.V.!”
And then Little Cat B/Cleaned up the T.V.
He cleaned it with milk,/Put the spot in a pan!/And then C blew it out/Of the house with a fan! 
“But look where it went!”/I said. “Look where it blew!/You blew the mess/Out of the house. That is true./But now you made Snow Spots!/You can’t let them stay!”/“Let us think about that now,”/Said C, B and A. 
“With some help, we can do it!”/Said Little Cat C./Then pop! On his head/We saw Little Cat D!/Then, pop! pop! pop!/Little Cats E, F and G!
“We will clean up that snow/If it takes us all day!/If it takes us all night,/We will clean it away!”/Said Little Cats G, F, E, D, C, B, A.
They ran out of the house then/And we ran out, too./And the Big Cat laughed,/“Now you will see something new!
My cats are all clever./My cats are good shots./My cats have good guns./They will kill all those spots!”
But this did not look/Very clever to me./Kill snow spots with pop guns?/That just could not be! 
“All this does is make more spots!”/We yelled at the cat./“Your cats are no good./Put them back in your hat./“Take your Little Cats G,/F, E, D, C, B, A./Put them back in your hat/And you take them away!”
“Oh, no!” said the cat./“All they need is more help./Help is all that they need./So keep still and don’t yelp.” 
Then Little Cat G/Took the hat off his head./“I have Little Cat H/Here to help us,” he said./“Little Cats H, I, J,/K, L and M./But our work is so hard/We must have more than them./We need Little Cat N./We need O. We need P./We need Little Cats Q, R, S, T,/U and V.” 
“Come on! Kill those spots!/Kill the mess!” yelled the cats./And they jumped at the snow/With long rakes and red bats./They put it in pails/And they made high pink hills!/Pink snow men! Pink snow balls!/And little pink pills! 
Oh, the things that they did!/And they did them so hard,/It was all one big spot now/All over the yard!
But the Big Cat stood there/And he said, “This is good./This is what they should do/And I knew that they would. /“With a little more help,/All the work will be done./They need one more cat./And I know just the one.” 
“Look close! In my hand/I have Little Cat V./On his head are Cats W,/X, Y, and Z”
“Z is too small to see./So don’t try. You can not/But Z is the cat/Is the cat who will clean up that spot!”
“Now here is the Z/You can’t see,” said the Cat./“And I bet you can’t guess/What he has in his hat!/“He has something called voom./Voom is so hard to get,/You never saw anything/Like it, I bet.
Why, Voom cleans up anything/Clean as can be!”/Then he yelled,/“Take your hat off now,/Little Cat Z!/Take the Voom off your head!/Make it clean up the snow!/Hurry! You Little Cat!/One! Two! Three! go!” 
Then the Voom, it went voom!/And oh boy! What a voom!
Now, don’t ask me what Voom is./I never will know./But, boy! Let me tell you/It does clean up snow!
“So you see!” laughed the Cat,/“Now your snow is all white!/Now your work is all done!/Now your house is all right!
And you know where my little cats are?”/Said the cat./“That Voom blew my little cats/Back in my hat.
And so, if you ever/Have spots, now and then,/I will be very happy/To come here again . . .
﻿I was real happy and carefree and young,/And I lived in a place called the Valley of Vung./Nothing, not anything, ever went wrong,/Until... well, one day I was walking along,
And I guess I got careless. I guess I got gawking/At daisies and not looking where I was walking...
And that's how it started. Sock! What a shock!/I stubbed my big toe on a very hard rock./I flew through the air, and I went for a sail,/And I sprained the main bone in the tip of my tail!
Now, I never had ever had trouble before,/So I said to myself, "I don't want any more."/"If I watch out for rocks, with my eyes straight ahead,/I'll keep out of trouble forever," I said.
But, watching ahead... well, it just didn't work./I was watching those rocks. Then I felt a hard jerk./A very fresh, green-headed Quilligan Quail/Sneaked up from in back and went after my tail!
And I learned there are troubles of more than one kind./Some come from ahead, and some come from behind
So I said to myself, "Now, I'll just have to start/To be twice as careful and be twice as smart./I'll watch out for trouble in front and back sections/By aiming my eyeballs in different directions."
I found this to be quite a difficult stunt,/But now I was safe, both in back and in front.
Then new troubles came from above and below!/A Skritz at my neck! And a Skrink at my toe!/And now I was really in trouble, you know./The rocks! And the Quail! And the Skritz! And the Skrink!/I had so many troubles, I just couldn't think!
There I was, all completely surrounded by trouble,/When a chap rumbled up in a One-Wheeler Wubble./"Young fellow," he said, "what has happened to you/Has happened to me and to other folks, too./So I'll tell you what I have decided to do....
I'm off to the City of Solla Sollew/On the banks of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo,/Where they never have troubles! At least, very few.
It is not very far. /And my camel is strong./He'll get us there fast. /So hop on! Come along! 
I jumped up behind him. Then all through that day,/The Wubble wubbled on in a wobblesome way./The road got more bumpy, more rocky, more tricky./By midnight, I tell you, my stomach felt icky.
And so I said, "Mister, please, when do we get/To that wonderful town? Aren't we almost there yet?"/"Young fellow," he told me, "don't start in to stew./At sunrise, we'll drive into Solla Sollew,/And you'll have no more troubles. I promise. I do."
But when dawn finally came and the darkness got light,/That wonderful city was nowhere in sight./Instead of the city, we ran into trouble./Our camel got sick and he started to bubble./We had to pull him in the One-Wheeler Wubble!
So there we were, in a dreadful position./Our camel sure needed a camel physician.
Now, doctors for camels are not often seen./Especially on mountains. They're far, far between./But we pulled that old Wubble and set out to find/Some doctor, while dragging our camel behind.
I pulled, pulled and pulled. Then the next thing I knew,/I was pulling the camel and Wubble chap, too!/"Now, really!" I thought, "this is rather unfair!"/But he said, "Don't you stew. I am doing my share.
"This is called teamwork. I furnish the brains./You furnish the muscles, the aches and the pains./I'll pick the best roads, tell you just where to go,/And we'll find a good doctor more quickly, you know."
Then he sat and he worked with his brain and his tongue,/And he bossed me around just because I was young./He told me go left. Then he told me go right./And that's what he told me all day and all night.
Next morning we located Dr. Sam Snell,/Who knew all about tonsils and camels as well./Our camel, he said, had a bad case of gleeks/And should lie flat in bed for at least twenty weeks
I was tired. How I wanted to crawl in that bed!/But the Wubble chap sent me away and he said,/"Your troubles are practically all at an end./Just run down that hill and around the next bend,/And you'll come to the Happy Way Bus Route, my friend.
The Happy Way Bus leaves at 4:42/And will take you directly to Solla Sollew/On the banks of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo,/Where they never have troubles. At least, very few."
Well.../The bus stop was there, and that part was just fine./But tacked on a stick was a very small sign/Saying, "Notice to Passengers Using our Line:/We are sorry to say that our driver, Butch Meyers,/Ran over four nails and has punctured all tires.
So, until further notice, the 4:42/Cannot possibly take you to Solla Sollew.../"But I wish you a most pleasant journey by feet./Signed, Bus Line President, Horace P. Sweet."
So I went on by feet, thanks to Horace P. Sweet./And that Horace P. Sweet almost ruined my feet!
A hundred miles later, my feet were so sore!/Then, wouldn't you know it! It started to pour!
I was drenched to the skin when a chap in a slicker/Splashed up and he yelled, "It's the Midwinter Jicker!
The Midwinter Jicker came early this year/And it's not going to be very comfy 'round here./Any fool would get out! So I've packed up my things/And I'm off to my granddaddy's, out in Palm Springs.
Take cover!" he yelled. "Use my house if you wish."/Then the chap in the slicker splashed off like a fish.
I ran in the house and I fell in a heap./I needed my rest, but I just couldn't sleep.
Did you ever sleep when your feet were like ice,/With a family of owls and a family of mice?/I listened all night to the growls and the yowls/And the chattering teeth of those mice and those owls,/While the Midwinter Jicker howled horrible howls.
I tossed and I flipped and I flopped and I flepped./It was quarter past five when I finally slept.
Then I dreamed I was sleeping on billowy billows/Of soft silk and satin marshmallow-stuffed pillows./I dreamed I was sleeping in Solla Sollew/On the banks of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo,/Where they never have troubles. At least, very few
Then I woke up, and it just wasn't true./I was crashing downhill in a flubbulous flood/With suds in my eyes and my mouth full of mud/And my nose full of water, my ears full of shrieks/Of the owls flying off with the mice on their beaks!
And I said to myself, "Now I really don't see/Why troubles like this have to happen to me!"
I floated twelve days without toothpaste or soap./I practically, almost had given up hope/When someone up high shouted, "Here! Catch the rope!"/Then I knew that my troubles had come to an end/And I climbed up the rope, calling, "Thank you, my friend!"
I got to the top. But it wasn't a friend!/And I saw that my troubles were not at an end./A big man on a horse scared me out of my wits./He bellowed, "I'm General Genghis Khan Schmitz.
"There's a war going on! And it's time that you knew/Every lad in this land has his duty to do./We're marching to battle. We need you, my boy./We're about to attack. We're about to destroy/The Perilous Poozer of Pompelmoose Pass!/So, get into line! You're a Private, First Class!"
He gave me a shooter and one little bean,/Which was not very much, if you see what I mean./Then he yelled, "Get that Poozer! Attack without fear!/The glorious moment of victory is near!"
And the glorious general led the advance/With a glorious swish of his sword and his lance/And a glorious clank of his tin-plated pants.
Then we went 'round a corner and found that, alas,/There was more than one Poozer in Pompelmoose Pass!
And Genghis Khan Schmitz shouted out to his men,/"This happens in war every now and again./Sometimes you are winners. Sometimes you are losers./We never can win against so many Poozers,
And so I suggest that it's time to retreat!"/And the army raced off on its tin-plated feet.
There I was!/With more Poozers than I'd ever seen!/There I was!/With my shooter and only one bean!/There I was!/And I thought, "Will I ever get through/To the wonderful city of Solla Sollew/On the bank of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo,/Where the never have troubles, at least very few?
I had terrible trouble in staying alive./Then I saw an old pipe that said, "Vent Number Five."/I didn't have time to find out what that meant,/But the vent had a hole. And the hole's where I went.
Well, that vent where I went/Was a sort of a funnel/That led me down into/A frightful black tunnel./The traffic down there/Was a mess, I must say./With billions of birds/Going all the wrong way.
They bumped me with bikes/And they banged me with dishes./I ran into ladders,/Beds, bottles, and fishes./I skidded on garbage./I fell in a horn./Then I wished I had never been born!
I was down there three days in that bird-filled-up place./At least eight thousand times, I fell smack on my face,/I injured three fingers, both thumbs and both lips,/My shinbone, my backbone, my wishbone and hips!
What's more, I was starved./I had nothing to eat. /And damp! Was it damp! /I grew moss on my feet!
Then, just when I thought I could stand it no more,/By chance I discovered a tiny trap door./I popped my head out. The great sky was sky-blue/And I knew, from the flowers, I'd finally come through/To the banks of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo./I couldn't be far now from Solla Sollew!
There it was! With its glittering towers in the air!/I'd made it! I'd done it! At last, I was there!/And I knew that I'd left all my troubles behind/When a chap at a doorway that shimmered and shined/Waved me a wave that was friendly and kind.
"Welcome!" he said as he gave me his hand./"Welcome, my son, to this beautiful land.
Welcome to sweet, sunny Solla Sollew,/Where we never have troubles, at least very few./As a matter of fact, we have only just one./Imagine! Just one little trouble, my son./And this one little trouble, as you will now see,/Is this one little trouble I have with this key...
"There is only one door into Solla Sollew/And we have a Key-Slapping Slippard. We do!/This troublesome Slippard moved into my door/Two weeks ago Tuesday at quarter to four./Since then, I can't open this door anymore!
And I can't kill the Slippard. It's very bad luck/To kill any Slippard, and that's why we're stuck/And why no one gets in and the town's gone to pot./It's a terrible state of affairs, is it not!
"And so," said the Doorman of Solla Sollew,/"My job at the door here is finished. I'm through!
And I'll tell you what I have decided to do.../"I'm leaving," he said, "leaving Solla Sollew/On the banks of the beautiful River Wah-Hoo,/Where we never have troubles, at least very few.
And I'm off to the city of Boola Boo Ball/On the banks of the beautiful River Woo-Wall,/Where they never have troubles! No troubles at all./Come on along with me," he said as he ran,/"And you'll never have any more troubles, young man."
I'd have no more troubles.../That's what the man said. /So I started to go. /But I didn't. Instead... /I did some quick thinking/Inside of my head.
Then I started back home/To the Valley of Vung./I know I'll have troubles. /I'll maybe get stung./I'll always have troubles./I'll maybe get bit/By that Green-Headed Quail/On the place where I sit./But I've bought a big bat./I'm all ready, you see./Now my troubles are going/To have troubles with me!
