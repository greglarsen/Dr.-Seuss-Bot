When I leave home to walk to school, Dad always says to me, 'Marco, keep your eyelids up And see what you can see." 
But when I tell him where I've been And what I think I've seen, He looks at me and sternly says, "Your eyesight's much too keen."

Stop telling such outlandish tales. Stop turning minnows into whales.

Now, what can I say When I get home today?

All the long way to school And all the way back, 
I've looked and I've looked And I've kept careful track, 
But all that I've noticed, Except my own feet, 
Was a horse and a wagon On Mulberry Street.

That's nothing to tell of, That won't do, of course... 
Just a broken-down wagon That's drawn by a horse. 
That can't be my story. That's only a start. 
I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart! 
And that is a story that no one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street  

Yes, the zebra is fine, But I think it's a shame,
Such a marvelous beast With a cart that's so tame. 
The story would really be better to hear 
If the driver I saw were a charioteer. 
A gold and blue chariot's something to meet,
Rumbling like thunder down Mulberry Street

No, it won't do at all...
A zebra's too small.
A reindeer is better; He's fast and he's fleet,
And he'd look mighty smart On old Mulberry Street.

Hold on a minute! There's something wrong!

A reindeer hates the way it feels
To pull a thing that runs on wheels. 
He'd be much happier, instead,  
If he could pull a fancy sled.   

Hmmmm . . . A reindeer and sleigh . . .  
Say—anyone could think of that, 
А Jack or Fred ог Joe or Nat— 
Say, even Jane could think of that.

But it isn't too late to make one little change
A sleigh and an ELEPHANT! There’s something strange!
Say! That makes a story that nо one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.

But now I don't know... - It still doesn't seem right.
An elephant pulling a thing that's so light
Would whip it around in the air like a kite.
But he'd look simply grand  With a great big brass band!


A band that’s so good should have someone to hear it, 
But it's going so fast that it's hard to keep near it.
I'll put on a trailer! I know they won't mind  
If a man sits and listens while hitched on behind.

But now is it fair? Is it fair what I've done?
I'll bet those wagons weigh more than a ton.  
Thats really too heavy a load for one beast; 
I'll give him some helpers. He needs two, at least.

But now what worries me is this . .    
Mulberry Street runs into Bliss.  
Unless there's something I can fix up, 
There'll be an awful traffic mix-up!

It takes Police to do the trick,     
То guide them through where traffic's thick
It takes Police to do the trick.  
They'll never crash now. They'll race at top speed
With Sergeant Mulvaney, himself, in the lead.
The Mayor is there And the Aldermen too, 
All waving big banners Of red, white and blue.   

The Mayor is there And he thinks it is grand,
And he raises his hat As they dash by the stand.   

And that is a story that NO ONE can beat
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street!   

With a roar of its motor an airplane appears     
And dumps out confetti while everyone cheers  
And that makes a story that's really not bad  
But it still could be better. Suppose that I add...
I Chinaman Who eats with sticks, 
A big Magician Doing tricks... 
A ten-foot beard That needs a comb...
Not time for more, I'm almost home.

I swung 'round the corner And dashed through the gate, 
I ran up the steps And I felt simply GREAT!
    
But Dad said quite calmly, "Just draw up your stool 
And tell me the sights On the way home from school."    
There was so much to tell, I JUST COULDN'T BEGIN! 
Dad looked at me sharply and pulled at his chin. 
He frowned at me sternly from there in his seat, 
“Was there nothing to look at . . . no people to greet? 
Did nothing excite you or make your heart beat?"

FOR I HAD A STORY THAT NO ONE COULD BEAT!
AND TO THINK THAT I SAW IT ON MULBERRY STREET!

"Nothing," I said, growing red as a beet, 
"But a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street."   

IN THE beginning, Bartholomew Cubbins didn’t have five hundred hats. 
He had only one hat. It was an old one that had belonged to his father and 
his father’s father before him.

It was probably the oldest and the plainest hat 
in the whole Kingdom of Didd, where Bartholomew Cubbins lived. But 
Bartholomew liked it — especially because of the feather that always pointed 
straight up in the air. 



The Kingdom of Didd was ruled by King 
Derwin. His palace stood high on the top of the 
mountain.

From his balcony, he looked down over 
the houses of all his subjects — first, over the spires 
of the noblemen’s castles, across the broad roofs 
of the rich men’s mansions, then over the little 
houses of the townsfolk, to the huts of the farmers 
far off in the fields. 

It was a mighty view and it made King Derwin 
feel mighty important. 
 

Far off in the fields, on the edge of a cranberry bog, stood the hut of the Cubbins family. 

From the small door 
Bartholomew looked across the huts of the farmers to the houses of the townsfolk, then to the rich men’s mansions and 
the noblemen’s castles, up to the great towering palace of the King. It was exactly the same view that King Derwin saw 
from his balcony, but Bartholomew saw it backward. 

It was a mighty view, but it made Bartholomew Cubbins feel mighty small. 

 
Just after sunrise one Saturday 
morning Bartholomew started for 
town. He felt very happy. 

A pleasant 
breeze whistled through the feather in 
his hat. In his right hand he carried a 
basket of cranberries to sell at the 
market. He was anxious to sell them 
quickly and bring the money back 
home to his parents. 

He walked faster and faster till he 
got to the gates of the town. 
The sound of silver trumpets rang 
through the air. Hoof beats clattered 
on the cobbled streets. 
“Clear the way! Clear the way! 
Make way for the King ! ” 

 
All the people rushed for the pavements. They drove their carts right up over the kerbstones. Bartholomew 
clutched his basket tighter. 

Around the comer dashed fifty trumpeters on yellow-robed horses. Behind them on crimson-robed horses 
came the King’s Own Guards. 

“Hats off to the King!” shouted the Captain of the King’s Own Guards. 

On came the King’s carriage — white and gold and purple. It rumbled like thunder through the narrow 
street. 

It swept past Bartholomew. Then suddenly its mighty brakes shrieked. It lurched — and then it stopped. 
The whole procession stood still. 

Bartholomew could hardly believe what he saw. Through the side window of the carriage, the King himself 
was staring back — straight back at him! Bartholomew began to tremble. 

“Back up!” the King commanded the Royal Coachman. 

The Royal Coachman shouted to the royal horses. The King’s Own Guards shouted to their crimson- 
robed horses. The trumpeters shouted to their yellow-robed horses. Very slowly the whole procession backed 
down the street, until the King’s carriage stopped right in front of Bartholomew. 

The King leaned from his carriage window and fixed his eyes directly on Bartholomew Cubbins. “Well. . .? 
Well...?” he demanded. 

Bartholomew shook with fright. “I ought to say something,” he thought to himself. But he could think of 
nothing to say. 

“Well?” demanded the King again. “Do you or do you not take off your hat before your King?” 

“Yes, indeed, Sire,” answered Bartholomew, feeling greatly relieved. “I do take off my hat before my 
King.” 

“Then take it off this very instant,” commanded the King more loudly than before. 

“But, Sire, my hat is off,” answered Bartholomew. 

“Such impudence!” shouted the King, shaking an angry finger. “How dare you stand there and tell me 
your hat is off!” 

“I don’t like to say you are wrong, Sire,” said Bartholomew very politely, “but you sec my hat is off.” And 
he showed the King the hat in his hand. 

“If that’s your hat in your hand,” demanded the King, “what’s that on your head?” 

“On my head?” gasped Bartholomew. There did seem to be something on his head. He reached up his 
hand and touched a hat! 



The face of Bartholomew Cubbins turned very red. ‘It’s a hat, Sire,” he stammered, “but it can ’t 
be mine. Someone behind me must have put it on my head.” 

“I don’t care how it got there,” said the King. “You take it off.” And the King sat back in his 
carriage. 

Bartholomew quickly snatched off the hat. He stared at it in astonishment. It was exactly the same 
as his own hat — the same size, the same colour. And it had exactly the same feather. 

‘ ‘By the Crown of my Fathers!” roared the King, again leaning out of the carriage window. “Did 
I or did I not command you to take off your hat?” 

“You did, Sire. ... I took it off... I took it off twice.” 

“Nonsense ! There is still a hat upon your head.” 

“Another hat?” Again Bartholomew reached up his hand and touched a hat. 

“Come, come, what is the meaning of all this?” demanded the King, his face purple with rage. 

“I don’t know, Sire,” answered Bartholomew. “It never happened to me before.” 

The King was now shaking with such fury that the carriage rocked on its wheels and the Royal 
Coachman could hardly sit in his seat. “Arrest this impudent trickster,” shouted the King to the Captain 
of the King’s Own Guards. “We’ll teach him to take offhis hat.” 



The Royal Coachman cracked his long whip. The King’s carriage swung 
forward up the street toward the palace. 

But the Captain of the King’s Own Guards leaned down from his big brass 
saddle and grabbed Bartholomew Cubbins by his shirt. Away flew 
Bartholomew’s basket! The cranberries bounced over the cobblestones and 
rolled down into the gutter. 

With a jangling of spurs and a clatter of hotseshoes, the Captain and 
Bartholomew sped up the winding street toward the palace. Out of the narrow 
streets, on up the hill! Bartholomew clung to the Captain’s broad back. On and 
on they galloped, past the bright gardens of the wealthy merchants. Higher and 
higher up the mountain, on past the walls of the noblemen’s castles. .. . 



Flupp !.... the sharp wind whisked olf Bartholomew’s hat. Flupp Flupp .... two more flew off. Flupp 
Flupp Flupp flew another . . . and another. “... 4 ... 5 .. - 6 . .. 7 ...” Bartholomew kept counting as the 
hats came faster and faster. Lords and ladies stared from the windows of their turrets, wondering what 
the strange stream of hats could mean. 

Over the palace drawbridge they sped — through the great gates, and into the courtyard. The Captain 
pulled in his reins. 

“His Majesty waits in the Throne Room,” said a guard, saluting the Captain. 

“The Throne Room! ” The Captain dropped Bartholomew to the ground. “I’d certainly hate to be in 
your shoes,” he said, shaking his head sadly. 

For a moment Bartholomew was terribly frightened. “Still,” he thought to himself, “the King can do 
nothing dreadful to punish me, because I really haven’t done anything wrong. It would be cowardly to 
feel afraid.” 

Bartholomew threw back his shoulders and marched straight ahead into the palace. “Follow the 
black carpet,” said the guard at the door. All through the long hallway Bartholomew could hear the 
muttering of voices behind heavy doors. “He won’t take off his hat?” “No, he won’t take off his hat.” 



Bartholomew walked on till he stood 
in the very middle of the Throne Room. 

The King, in a long scarlet robe, was sitting on 
his throne. Beside him stood Sir Aiaric, Keeper of 
the King’s Records. He wore in his belt, instead of a 
sword, a long silver ruler. Lords and noblemen of the 
court stood solemn and silent. 

The King looked down at Bartholomew severely. “Young man, I’ll give you one 
more chance. Will you take off your hat for your King?” 

“Your Majesty,” said Bartholomew as politely as he possibly could, “I will — but 
I’m afraid it won’t do any good.” And he took offhis hat — and it didn’t do any good. 
Another hat sat on Bartholomew’s head. He took off hat after hat after hat after hat 
until he was standing in the middle of a great pile of hats. 

The lords and noblemen were so astonished they couldn’t even speak. Such a thing 
had never happened in the Throne Room before. 



“Heavens!” said Sir Alaric, Keeper of the Records, 
blinking behind his triangular spectacles. “He’s taken off 
45!” 

“And there were 3 more down in the town,” said the 
King. 

“And you must add on 87 more that blew off my head 
as we galloped up the hill,” said Bartholomew, trying to 
be helpful. 

“One hundred and thirty-five hats ! Most unusual,” said 
Sir Alaric, writing it down on a long scroll. 

“Come, come,” said the King impatiently. “Sir Alaric, 
what do you make of all this nonsense?” 

“Very serious nonsense, Your Maj esty,” answered Sir 
Alaric. “I advise you to call in an expert on hats.” 

“Excellent,” agreed the King. “Ho, Guard! Fetch in 
Sir Snipps, maker of hats for all the fine lords.” 


Into the Throne Room marched the smallest man, 
wearing the tallest hat that Bartholomew had ever seen. It 
was Sir Snipps. Instead of a sword, he wore at his side a 
large pair of scissors. 

“Take a look at this boy’s hat,” commanded the King. 
Sir Snipps looked at Bartholomew Cubbins’ hat and 
sniffed in disgust. Then he turned to the King and bowed 
stiffly. “Your Majesty, I, Sir Snipps, am the maker of hats 
for all the fine lords. I make hats of cloth of gold, fine si lks 
and gems and ostrich plumes. You ask me what I think of 
this hat? Pooh! It is the most ordinary hat I ever set eyes 
on.” 

“In that case,” said the King, “it should be very simple 
for you to take it off.” 

“Simple, indeed,” mumbled Sir Snipps haughtily, and, 
standing on his tiptoes, he pushed his pudgy thumb at 
Bartholomew’s hat and knocked it to the floor. 
Immediately another appeared on Bartholomew’s head. 




“Screebees! ” screamed Sir Snipps, leaping in the air higher than he is tall. Then he turned and ran shrieking 
out of the Throne Room. 



“Dear me! ” said the King, looking very puzzled. “If 
Snipps can’t doit, this must be more than an ordinary 
hat.” 

“One hundred and thirty-six,” wrote Sir Alaric wrinkling 
his brow. “Your Majesty, I advise that you call 

in your Wise Men.” 

“A fine idea!” said the King. “Ho, Guard! bring me 
Nadd. Nadd knows about everything in all my kingdom.” 

In came an old, old man. He looked at the hat on 
Bartholomew’s head, and he looked at the pile of hats on 
the floor. 

“Nadd, my Wise Man, can you take off his hat?” asked 
the King. Nadd shook his head solemnly — solemnly no. 



“Then fetch me the Father of Nadd,” commanded the 
King. “He knows about everything in all my kingdom and 
in all the- world beyond.” 


In came an even older man. But when he looked at 
Bartholomew’s hats, the Father of Nadd merely locked 
his fingers across his beard and said nothing. 


‘Then bring me the Father of the Father ofNadd!” ordered 
the 

King. “He knows about everything in all my kingdom, in all 
the world beyond, and in all other worlds that may happen to 
be.” 

Then came the oldest man of them all. But he just looked at 
Bartholomew and nibbled nervously at the end of his beard. 

“Does this mean there is no one in my whole kingdom who 
can take off this boy’s hat?” bellowed the King in a terrifying 
voice. 

A small voice came up through the balcony window. “What’s 
the matter, Uncle Derwin?” To Bartholomew, it sounded like 
the voice of a boy. 

The King stepped out on the balcony and leaned over the 
marble railing. “There’s aboy inhere ...just about your age,” 
the King said. “He won’t take off his hat.” 


Bartholomew tiptoed up behind the King and looked 
down. There stood a boy with a big lace collar — a very 
proud little boy with his nose in the air. It was the Grand 
Duke Wilfred, nephew of the King. 

“You send him down here,” said the Grand Duke Wilfred. 
" I'll fix him.” 

The King thought for a minute. He pushed back his crown 
and scratched his head. “Well... Maybe you can. There’s 
no hann in trying.” 

“Take him to the Grand Duke Wilfred!” commanded 
the King. And two of the King’s Own Guards led 
Bartholomew out of the Throne Room. 





“Pooh ! ” said the Grand Duke Wilfred, looking at Bartholomew’s hat and laughing meanly. “ That 
hat won’t tome off? You stand over there.” He pointed to a comer where the wall curved out. “I 
need a little target practice with my bow and arrow.” 



When Bartholomew saw that the Grand 
Duke Wilfred had only a child’s bow he didn’t 
feel frightened. He spoke up proudly, “I can 
shoot with my father ’s big bow.” 

“My bow’s quite big enough for shooting 
hats — especially hats like yours,” answered 
Wilfred. And he let fly an arrow. zZZ! ... it 
grazed Bartholomew’s forehead and nipped 
off his hat. Away it blew, and over the 
parapet. But another hat appeared on his 
head. zzZ ! . . . zzZ ! . . . zzZ ! ... the arrows flew 
... till the Grand Duke ’s whole bagful of arrows 
was gone. And still a hat sat upon 
Bartholomew’s head. 

“It’s not fair,” cried the Grand Duke. “It’s 
not fair!” He threw down his bow and 
stamped upon it. 

“One hundred and fifty-four hats ! ’ ’ gulped 
SirAlaric. 



“These hats are driving me mad!” The King’s voice rang out through all the palace. “Why 
waste time with a child s bow and arrow. Fetch me the mightiest bow and arrow in all my 
realm — fetch the Yeoman of the Bowmen!” 


“Yeoman of the Bowmen,” echoed all the lords and noblemen of the court. 


A gigantic man strode out across the terrace. His bow was as big as the branch of a tree. The 
arrow was twice as long as Bartholomew, and thicker than his wrist. 


“Yeoman of the Bowmen,” said the King, “shoot off this boy’s hat... and make it stay off!” 


G — r — r—zibb !. . . Like a mad giant hornet 
the arrow tore through the air towards 
Bartholomew Cubbins. 

G — r — r — zapp/... The sharp arrow-head 
bit through his hat and carried it off — on and 
on for a full half mile. 

G~r — r — zoppf. . . It plunked to a stop in 
the heart of an oak tree. Yet there on 
Bartholomew’s head sat another hat. 



Bartholomew was trembling so hard that he could scarcely stand straight. The Yeoman bent 
back his mighty bow. 





The face of the Yeoman of the Bowmen went as white as the palace walls. “It’s black magic ! ” he shrieked. 

“Black magic, that’s just what it is,” sighed the King with relief. “I should have thought of that before. That 
makes things simple. Back to the Throne Room! Call my magicians! ” 

In the whole Throne Room there wasn’t a sound as loud as a breath. But from the spiral stairs that led down 
from the southwest tower came the shuffling of slow, padded feet. The magicians were coming! Low and slow, 
they were chanting words that were strange . . . 

“Dig a hole five furlongs deep, 

Down to where the night makes creep, 

Mix and mould the mystic mud, 

Malber, Bather, Tidder, Tudd. ” 

In came seven black-gowned magicians, and beside each one stalked a lean black cat. They circled around 
Bartholomew Cubbins muttering deep and mysterious sounds. 

“Stop this useless muttering,” ordered the King. “I want a chant that will charm away this boy’s hat.” 

The magicians huddled over Bartholomew and chanted. 

“Winkibus 

Tinkibus 

Fotiches 

Klay, 

Hat on this demon s head, 

Fly far away! 

Howl, men, howl away, 

Howl away, howl away, 

Yowl, cats, yowl away, 

Yowl away, yowl away! 

Hat on this demon s head, 

Step away, creep away, leap away, gleap away, 

Never come back! ” 


“A mighty good chant,” said the King, looking very pleased. “Are you sure it will work?” 

All the magicians nodded together. 

“But,” said the King, looking puzzled, “there still seems to be a hat upon his head. How long will it take for 
the chann to work?” 

“ Be calm, oh. Sire, and hare no fears, ” chanted the magicians. 

“Our charm will work in ten short years. ” 

“Ten years’” gasped the King. “Away, fools!” he shouted. “Out of my sight! I can’t wait ten years to get 
rid of his hat. Oh, dear, what can I do ... what can I do?” 

“If I were King,” whispered the Grand Duke Wilfred, “I’d chop off his head.” 

“A dreadful thought,” said the King, biting his iip. “But I’m afraid I’ll have to.” 



“Young man,” he said to Bartholomew Cubbins, and he pointed to a small door at the end of the 
room, “march down those steps to the dungeon and tell the executioner to chop off your head.” 

Bartholomew’s heart sank into his boots, but he did as the King commanded. “I must take off 
my hat,” he said to himself as he started down the long black stairway. “This is my last chance.” One 

hat after another he tore from his head “... 156... 157 ... 158 ...” It grew colder and damper. “. 
.. 217 ... 218 ... 219 ...” Down . . . down . . .down. “... 231 ... 232 ... 233.. .” It seemed to 
Bartholomew he must be in the very heart of the mountain. 

“Who’s there?” said a voice from the blackness. 

Bartholomew turned a comer and stepped into the dungeon. 



The executioner was whistling and swinging his axe idly, because at the moment he had nothing to 
do. In spite of his business, he really seemed to be a very pleasant man. 

“The King says you must chop olf my head,” said Bartholomew. “Oh, I’d hate to,” said the executioner, 
looking at him with a friendly smile. “You seem such a nice boy.” 

“Well ... the King says you have to,” said Bartholomew, “so please get it over with.” 

“All right,” sighed the executioner, “but first you’ve got to take off your hat.” 

“Why?” asked Bartholomew. 

“I don’t know,” said the executioner, “but it’s one of the rules. I can’t execute anyone with his hat 
on.” 

“All right,” said Bartholomew, “you take it off for me.” 

The executioner leaned across the chopping block and flipped off Bartholomew’s hat. 

“What’s this?” he gasped, blinking through the holes in his mask, as another hat sat on Bartholomew’s 
head. He flipped this one off... then another and another. 



“Fiddlesticks!” grunted the executioner, throwing his axe on the floor. “I can’t execute you at all.” And he 
shook hands with Bartholomew and sent him back upstairs to the King. 

The King had been taking a nap on the throne. “What are you doing back here?” he said to Bartholomew, 
angry at being awakened. 

“I’m sorry, Your Majesty,” explained Bartholomew. “My head can’t come off with my hat on. ... It’s 
against the rules.” 

“So it can’t,” said the King, leaning back wearily. “Now how many hats does that make altogether?” 

“The executioner knocked off 13... and I left 178 more on the dungeon steps,” answered Bartholomew. 

“Three hundred and forty-six hats,” mumbled Sir Alaric from behind his scroll. 

“Uncle Derwin,” yawned the Grand Duke Wilfred, “I suppose I’ll have to do away with him. Send him 
up to the highest turret and I, in person, will push him off.” 

“Wilfred! I’m surprised at you,” said the King. “But I guess it’s a good idea.” 

So the King and the Grand Duke led Bartholomew Cubbins toward the highest turret. 

Up and up and up the turret stairs he climbed behind them. 

“This is my last — my very last chance,” thought Bartholomew. He snatched olThis hat. “Three hundred 
and forty-seven!” He snatched off another. He pulled and he tore and he flung them behind him. “. . .398 .. 
399 . . .” His arms ached from pulling off hats. But still the hats came. Bartholomew climbed on. 

“.. . 448 . .. 449. . . 450 . . .” counted Sir Alaric, puffing up the stairs behind him. 



Suddenly Sir Alaric stopped. He looked. He took 
off his triangular spectacles and wiped them on his 
sleeve. And then he looked again. The hats began to 
change! Hat 45 1 had, not one, but two feathers! Hat 
452 had three . . . and 453 also had three and a little 
red jewel! Each new hat was fancier than the hat just 
before. 

“Your Majesty! Your Majesty !” cried out Sir Alaric. 

But the King and the Grand Duke were far up where 
they couldn’t hear. They had akeady reached the top 
of the highest turret. Bartholomew was following just 
behind. 

“Step right out here and get out on that wall,” 
snapped the Grand Duke Wilfred. “I can’t wait to push 
you off.” 



But when Bartholomew stepped up on the wall they gasped in amazement. He was wearing the most beautiful 
hat that had ever been seen in the Kingdom of Didd. It had a ruby larger than any the King himself had ever owned. 
It had ostrich plumes, and cockatoo plumes, and mockingbird plumes, and paradise plumes. Beside such a hat 
even the King’s Crown seemed like nothing. 


The Grand Duke Wilfred took a quick step forward. Bartholomew thought his end had come at last. 


“Wait ! ” shouted the King. He could not take his eyes off the magnificent hat. 


“I won ’t wait,” the Grand Duke talked back to the King. “I’m going to push him off now! That new big hat 
makes me madder than ever.” And he flung out his arms to push Bartholomew off. 



But the King was quicker than Wilfred. He grabbed him by the back of his fine lace collar. 
“This is to teach you,” His Majesty said sternly, “that Grand Dukes never talk back to their 
King.” And he turned the Grand Duke Wilfred over his knee and spanked him soundly, right 
on the seat of his royal silk pants. 

“And now,” smiled the King, lifting Bartholomew down from the wall, “it would be nice if 
you’d sell me that wonderful hat! ” 

“. . . 498 . . . -499 . . .” broke in the tired voice of Sir Alaric, who had just arrived at the 
top of the steps, “and that ...” he pointed to the hat on Bartholomew’s head, “makes 
exactly 500!” 

“Five Hundred! ” exclaimed the King. “Will you sell it for 500 pieces of gold?” 

“Anything you say, Sire,” answered Bartholomew. “You see ... I’ve never sold one before.” 

The King’s hands trembled with joy as he reached for the hat. 

Slowly, slowly, Bartholomew felt the weight of the great hat lifting from his head. He held 
his breath. . . . Then suddenly he felt the cool evening breezes blow through his hair. His face 
broke into a happy smile. The head of Bartholomew Cubbins was bare! 


“Look, Your Majesty! Look! ” he shouted to the King. 



“No! You look at me, ” answered the King. And he put the great hat on right over his crown. 

Ann in arm, the King and Bartholomew went down to the counting room to count out the gold. Then the 
King sent Bartholomew home to his parents ... no basket on his arm, no hat on his head, but with five 
hundred pieces of gold in a bag. 

And the King commanded that the hat he had bought, and all the other hats, too, be kept forever in a 
great crystal case by the side of his throne. 

But neither Bartholomew Cubbins, nor King Dcrwin himself, nor anyone else in the Kingdom of Didd 
could ever explain how the strange thing had happened. They only could say it just “happened to happen” 
and was not very likely to happen again.
